Analysis
<div><ul><li>Collective intelligence on crowdsourcing sites could be compared to swarm intelligence: does someone have to understand the big picture? Are the tasks of individuals simple compared to the task of a whole? etc.</li><li>Positive feedback is not the only feedback that can support motivation, or "positive" must be defined very broadly. Compare to 4chan...</li><li>One way to think of the differences between various crowdsourcing sites is to think how elements are distributed. OpenIDEO feels like a common memory, which all the agents read and write using their own "algorithms". On the other hand Foldit has central memory and algorithm to interact with the memory is the same for all the agents. Processing of information is distributed, but the actions are much more restricted.</li><li><b>Collective intelligence = reducing the complexity of the task for the individual!??</b></li></ul></div></body></html>
