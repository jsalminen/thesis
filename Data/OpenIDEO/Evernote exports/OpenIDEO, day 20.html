<li>I feel like I have different phases in coding depending on what kind of issues I happen to have in my mind. There's some codes I use very much for a while, and then I use some other set of codes a lot while the previously common ones are ignored. Is this bias or a result of types of data I happen to code? Now I'm doing mostly comments, and they are a lot about interaction, feedback and development. Before I used rules, tasks, marketing and community a lot. Large part of that material was created by OpenIDEO.</li>

<li>Tasks + Idea evaluation</li>
<li>Tasks + Development</li>
<li>Tasks + Implementation</li>
</ul>

<li>Extract the essence of tasks on post-it notes</li>
