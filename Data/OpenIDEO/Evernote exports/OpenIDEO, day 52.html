<div><br/></div><div><ul><li>Applauded Power of music. Gangnam Style!!!</li><li>Applauded How I first heard of IDEO</li><li>Applauded HIP methodology. All these based on the title, no reading, even completely the summaries</li><li>Applauded OpenIDEO - design better for social good</li><li>Applauded waste equals food</li><li>Applauded Example as requested: Virgin making change for good? Had been requested, and someone delivered. Appreciate that.</li><li>Applauded Starbucks refill gamification. Just because. Sort of protests, didn't have any applause yet</li><li>Applauded free online education. Definitely like this one!</li><li>Applauded Guardian sustainable business awards</li><li>Checked the comment my MIT Inspiration had received</li><li>Applauded Coming together for a common cause / Kickstarter</li><li>Opened The Sharing economy.
