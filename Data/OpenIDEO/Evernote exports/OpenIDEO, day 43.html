Checked the site. Doesn't feel very active, compared to Quirky. Only thing left for me to do is evaluate some concepts, but I don't feel like it. 9 concepts to evaluate in Unemployment challenge and oh wait! Evaluation phase of e-waste challenge has concluded! Winners will be announced in 19 hours! I could still applaud the concepts if I wanted to, but don't want to do it. Might contamine the data, in case I want to collect something later. I probably should collect the evaluations, so I can later check if they correlate with the decisions. I'll do it tomorrow.
