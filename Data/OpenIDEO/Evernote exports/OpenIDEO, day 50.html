Participating to inspiration phase. This was quite easy, but relatively time-consuming. I browsed Evernote to see what I have already collected on sustainability and environment. Found an article about sustainability in NASCAR racing and turned that to an inspiration. It fit to one of the missions, too. Making it was actually fun and easy. Mostly copy-paste, and the end results looks pretty, with an image borrowed from flickr and all. Now checking business tag on Evernote. Maybe there's more useful stuff.
<div><ul><li>Made another inspiration out of MIT Sloan Management review special report on sustainability. Fast and easy, mostly copy-paste. Threw in my own photo for good measure.</li><li>Made an inspiration out of a TED talk by Derek Sivers on starting a movement. Again, fit nicely to one of the missions. Maybe not spot-on, but close enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></body></html>
