Woke up today with an idea to my concept for Unemployment challenge: a curriculum mashup!
<div><ul><li>Idea is to make a mashup of already existing free web courses from Coursera, Udacity, etc. to form a short curriculum which gives the student necessary skills to develop a web application and start running a small business</li><li>Content</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>HCI course to find a relevant problem and design an elegant solution</li><li>Code Acadamy: html and CSS</li><li>Udacity: Python basics and Web application engineering</li><li>OpenIDEO to give a context or topic</li><li><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium;">Kickstarter for funding</span></li></ul></li><li>After taking the basic courses on technical skills, the students would participate to HCI course, the topic of which comes from OpenIDEO challenge</li><li>Benefits:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Integrates already existing but a bit dispersed courses from different platforms to a neat package</li><li>More participants to OpenIDEO challenges. They are motivated by personal learning, but help solve some real problems. They also learn the necessary design skills as they go</li><li>The end result would be a big bunch of prototype web applications, some of which might even become a real business, with the help of Kickstarter or other crowdfunding solutions</li></ul></li><li>Needed resources: Not much. Already build a prototype (This could be done on Weebly)</li><li>Could also be turned to a game, where each skill set is like levels: You're a level 1 programmer!</li><li>Companies could make them the requirement: "We're looking for someone, who can do these &lt;list of courses&gt;"</li></ul><div>OpenIDEO site</div></div><div><ul><li>Research ethics: added my Twitter contact information, occupation (Researcher, PhD student) and affiliation (Lappeenranta University of Technology) to my profile page</li><li>Found brainstorm-in-a-box for youth unemployment challenge. They ARE case specific, and there IS one for each (at least new) challenge</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Confirmed by checking E-waste and Web startup challenges</li></ul></li><li>Checked the winning concepts of Web startup challenge, no-one had scooped my idea at least in the top ten</li></ul><div>Developing the idea</div></div><div><ul><li>This is actually quite enjoyable</li><li>Checking out the inspirations, going to bookmark relevant ones, just based on the topics (not looking details, list view)</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>I'm going to challenge page through the Challenges -tab</li><li>Filtering by most applauded</li><li>Bookmarked Ken Robinson's TED-talk. Would be handy if I could bookmark from the list view.</li><li>While scrolling trough the inspiration in search for complementing ideas to my mashup-idea, I noticed I was thinking whether AIESEC could be combined somehow. Seeing the inspirations and looking at them with an idea in mind makes you see connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Checked out Matthew Ippsteins non-traditional job application video</li><li>Getting bored at the fifth page</li><li>Pictures really are important for getting the attention, when scrolling the page full of inspirations or concepts</li><li>Noticed Hopscotch on Inspirations. "Our products teach children to..." Using OpenIDEO for personal marketing?</li><li>Scrolled trough ten pages of inspirations and clicked open to new tab about 19</li><li>Watched an inspirational video on World Peace Game. Had seen it before, but it was still interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Someone mentioned a need for more integrated approach (not exactly, but my interpretation) for online education. He had been taking courses on Code Academy, Udacity and Coursera. I take this as encouragement for my idea</li><li>Applauded on some of the Inspirations on the way. Wonder what happened to my DQ? Seems like nothing...</li></ul></li><li>Checking out some of the concepts. Looking for inspiration</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Default filters, Fresh and surprising</li><li>Applauded OpenIDEO as an concept / solution</li><li>Semi-mindlessly scrolled trough all the concepts. There weren't that many, after all. 134 in total. No-one had scooped my idea yet. Opened 9 concepts to new tabs for bookmarking &amp; applauding. Might have applauded some on the go already, can't remember.</li><li>Verified Skills actually is quite close. Should probably build on this</li></ul></li><li>Site doesn't feel that overwhelming anymore. It is possible to get a grasp of what's going on. Most efficient way I've found so far is just to scroll trough the inspirations and concepts. Would be interesting to see it from the beginning, but on the other hand, it's maybe good to experience it from a random starting point, as a real user would</li><li><br/></li></ul><div><br/></div></div><div>Methodology</div><div><ul><li>Forgot to clip also the comments on some of the inspirations and concepts.</li></ul></div></body></html>
