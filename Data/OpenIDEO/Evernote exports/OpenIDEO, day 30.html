Checking the site. E-waste challenge's applause phase has been extended again, this time for 4 days.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Evening. To the site. The plan is to read trough the concepts that made it to the refinement phase.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>First things first. Tax: 281 views, 12 comments, 6 applause, Curriculum: 140 views, 3 comments, 4 applause</li>
<li>Read and applauded Building expertise at the early age. Doing research at the same time as participating has an effect on what I do on the site: I just decided to read the comments only after uploading the concept to Dedoose. That way I'm saving a bit time.</li>
<li>Read Employers have the answers… There's good feedback in the comments from OpenIDEO on how to develop the concept further. Better check if they did the same in other challenges, too. </li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Very good feedback, indeed. Specific questions to answer and links to refinement instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Job interviews as learning experiences was apparently selected on shortlist almost solely on the basis of amount of applause and comments. It sure is a short and simple compared to other concepts I've skimmed trough so far (this is number 14 on shortlist).</li>
<li>Skimmed trough all the shortlisted concepts. It got a bit boring in the end, and I wasn't that thorough anymore, but many of the last concepts I was already somewhat familiar with. Now I have some idea on what kinds of ideas there are on the shortlist. Enough for today.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Methodology</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing the data with the biggest piles of excerpts could be done the following way</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ol>
<li>Select pages to analyze at random, using random number generator</li>
<li>Collect relevant facts on post-it notes</li>
<li>Repeat until bored</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This is somewhat in line with recommendations on qualitative analysis: continue until saturation is reached</li>
<li>Correct time to collect the shortlisted concepts is probably only after the evaluation phase. Then I will capture all the discussions and evaluations at once. Furhermore, the clipping of content does not disturb my user experience on the site.</li>
</ul>
