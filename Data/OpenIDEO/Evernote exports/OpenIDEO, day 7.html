<li>Woke up, collecting data already in my dreams. It felt boring.</li>
<li>Threshold to participate on OpenIDEO feels high, but it might just serve a purpose: Participants self-select, and only those motivated and skilled enough will participate, thus limiting the amount of low-quality inputs and keeping the spam out. I wonder how do they moderate the site?</li>

<li><font color="#010101">Found them with google search, at Field notes with the title The Rules of Brainstorming. I guess this is it.</font></li>
<li><font color="#010101">Good stuff! The whole thinking behind idea generation is explained here! Field notes might offer other good tips too. Better check em out!</font></li>
<li><font color="#010101">Being visual is one of the rules. Reminds me again about the Canv.as and 4chan. Lurking on them should be continued, and I should take a look at how the editing of pictures works on Canv.as. The user interface might offer some insights on this too. OpenIDEO ecourages visual approach, but does not offer photo editing tools on the site. All this must be done elsewhere. Come to think of it, Threadless has some kind of visual templates, if I remember right?</font></li>

<li><font color="#010101">Currents 15: It's nice to see the evolution of the site. Now the Tweet-ups are turning to OpenStorms, by combining a live meeting of people from Twitter with Brainstorm-in-a-box. Virtual communities at their best? Is this self-organization or what? Also, there's an explanation to Missions. They used to be assignments, but as it sounded too much like a work, they were changed. This might also explain the indirect style of tasks given on the site.</font></li>
