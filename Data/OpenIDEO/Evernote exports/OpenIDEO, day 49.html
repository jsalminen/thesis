Things I have done lately</div><ul><li>Collected yesterday statistics on Unemployment challenge shortlist views, applause and comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Last week wrote the OpenIDEO case description. Some parts are still missing, for example Inspiration and Refinement, but otherwise it's quite ok</li><li>Yesterday refined the coding scheme. It's ok now.</li></ul><div>To the site. Purpose is to at least check out the inspiration phase and hopefully participate a bit, too. Motivating myself to do this is a real challenge now.</div><div><ul><li>Reading through the missions. Each has a friendly Add Your Inspiration -button.</li><li>Missions feel (at least the first one) much more doable than the tasks I should have taken at Refinement phase, such as developing a business model, or understanding all the inspirations and creating a concept in concepting phase. Inspirations seem much easier, I only have to consider examples I know, without caring about the big picture.</li><li>Still, each mission has half a dozen inspiration examples. Should I look them through? It would take a lot of time. This is also possibly directing the users towards same kinds of inspirations.</li><li>These tasks still feel quite big and hairy. It's not that I can instantly jump into action. First I have to do some thinking to understand what's exactly going on here. The tasks are cognitively demanding. And there's many of them. Maybe I should just select one and try to do that. Or should I first read what others have posted?</li><li>275 Inspirations already. That's kinda scary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Finally understood the user interface of Collaboration map. This case, however, there are only a few inspirations on the map. Still not useful.</li><li>I'm somehow frustrated about the size of the tasks at OpenIDEO (am I purposefully wording my notes towards a predetermined conclusion?). I need to understand a lot. There's not many "cognitive shortcuts" that would allow me to understand the issue faster than if I was working completely alone. It's like only the collection of information is more effective, but I still have to go through it all by myself.</li><li>I don't feel like doing much thinking on this one today. I try to contribute by checking out some random inspirations (Fresh &amp; surprising) and applauding the ones I like</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Applauded Nobel price. Challenge terms and conditions popped up again. Clipped them, but didn't even consider reading</li><li>Applauded Harvard Business Review article on building company vision. Not much related to challenge, but the article might be useful for me somewhere else</li><li>Applauded zero waste brewery, even though it might be an advertisement by the company</li><li>Applauded Screw business as usual. Sounded like a proper inspiration. Book, that is a story how Virgin is changing business for good</li><li>Applauded incentives are the key. It's a featured inspiration and might be a TED-talk. Too lazy to check. I'm doing a poor job applauding. I have to do many of them to do even something meaningful. Maybe these small tasks could have framed so that they feel more meaningful. Now it seems like only working really hard to find something useful matters.</li><li>It feels like just applauding doesn't really matter. And no matter how much I applaud, there's still huge number of inspirations to look at.</li></ul></li><li>Actually I could probably browse all the inspirations in list view in the end of the phase and applaud the good ones then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Applauded 9Gag. I liked it.</li></ul></li><li>Applauded Inspiration phase lowdown. I don't know why. Doesn't really change anything.</li></ul></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
