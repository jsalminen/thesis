<li>There's still 5 days to make a concept to e-waste challenge. Maybe I should give it a try, as unemployment challenge is in a more calm phase and there's not that much interesting things to do</li>
<li>Opened and applauded Career-coffee mobile truck. Had seen it before, and the submitter had put a lot of effort in it. I appreciate the effort.</li>
<li>Getting boring really fast</li>
<li>Applauded Startup Scramble. It was the last concept on the list, someone thought it's a great idea and it had been featured by OpenIDEO. It also said 'startup'. Didn't bother to read trough.</li>

<li>Started following e-waste challenge</li>
<li>Checking out the challenge brief</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

<li>Listened the challenge video half-heartedly while browsing terms and conditions. They are way long!</li>

<li>Checking the inspirations for e-waste challenge</li>

<li>Battery collection from germany is featured. Sounds familiar to Finland. Not bothering to open</li>
<li>I notice I consider the hassle of clipping the page if I open it. This has an effect on my behavior on the site.</li>

<li>Browsing the most applauded inspirations<br/></li>

<li>I still don't understand the missions. They are there, but they don't seem to be doing much. They are almost like themes, but still not. I could tag an inspiration to a mission, but can I browse the inspirations based on the mission? If not, why are they there?</li>
<li>Yes, I indeed can browse by the mission. There's a filter for that.</li>
<li>Scrolling trough the inspiration list to get a general sense of what kinds of things there are</li>
<li>Applauded Design for disassembly? Laser printer inspiration. There was a nice time lapse video of disassembling a printer. When I applauded, it asked me to accept the challenge terms and conditions. Clicked yes before thinking. Didn't even have time to clip them.Â </li>
