Couple of days since the last visit. I wish the evaluation phase is still going on. Would like to evaluate some ideas before the challenges finish.
<div><ul><li>I'm suspecting Unemployment challenge evaluation phase has been extended. There's 10 days left.</li><li>I'll evaluate some concepts with least evaluations at the moment</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Evaluated Work experience time banking</li><li>Evaluated Toolbox. That was a fast evaluation.</li><li>Evaluated Youth Excellence scheme. Didn't like the aspect of using young people as free workforce</li><li>Evaluated ALT/loan. I actually liked this one. Like student loan, but for entrepreneurs.</li></ul></li><li>I'll evaluate a couple of concepts on the e-waste challenge, too</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Evaluated BuyCycle</li><li>Evaluated Stop Outmoding and start upgrading. I get the feeling the problem definition is the difficult part in the OpenIDEO challenges. People don't get it right, because there's usually so many interacting issues. I've seen several doomed concepts already on the shortlist. They just don't make sense when you take into account the incentives of companies and different interest groups, or the huge hassle of designing logistics to upgrade electronics en masse.</li><li>Evaluated Send old cellphones using the original box -concept. I liked this one</li><li>Evaluated Marketing campaign. It was long, so only skimmed through.</li><li>Evaluated Regenerate! I don't put that much though on the evaluations, I notice. The choice is not that difficult either, only three options, and wording the choices makes it usually easy to select one of the. The selection might tend to be the same, though, regardless of the concept being evaluated. It could be that I evaluate more the wording of choices rather than the concept.</li><li>Evaluated rewire. It was long, so I didn't read it. I still remember somewhat what it was about. Sort of business model for building new devices from old ones. I gave it mostly average evaluation.</li><li>Evaluated responsibility shift</li><li>Skimmed trough and evaluated Farmer's market e-waste booth. I liked it, although I basically only read the headlines.</li></ul></li></ul></div></body></html>
