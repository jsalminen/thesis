Very lazy day today regarding participation, but I got the post-it show on tasks pretty much done. It's evening and I feel too tired to concentrate on the site. I asked yesterday for tips about what concepts might support my idea, and already got two very thorough looking answers from Paul Reader. I've noticed he's very active on the site. There's lot's of links I should take a look at. This site seems to be demanding quite a lot attention and it's clearly trying to pull me in deeper. Just half-heartedly hanging around might be difficult. I'll have to take a look at the proposed concepts tomorrow and write a nice reply to Paul.Â

<div>The site might work like this:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>People send semi-random concepts to the site. Other people give enthusiastic positive feedback to promising ones, which encourages the posters to develop their concepts further. Then they get more committed, as it starts to seem possible to make it to the shortlist, or even winning concept. I catch my self wondering every now and then whether my concepts have any changes to make it to the shortlist. It might be that keeping people enthusiastic and motivated is more important in this site than "sophisticated" information processing mechanism, such as swarm algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<div>Methodology:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Just noticed activity feed. This data could be collected, too. It might show something interesting about interactions on the site. Wonder if I could automatically collect everything?</li>
</ul>
