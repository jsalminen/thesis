<div>Curriculum Mashup</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last year the world has seen the rise of many new platforms providing free courses on the web. Based on my personal experience the quality is very high, but they are still a bit scattered. The student has to figure out by himself what courses might be useful, and no-one's offering a full curriculum yet. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This issue could be easily solved by making a curriculum mashup: a website combining the courses offered by separate organizations to meaningful packages. Curriculum to become a Web Entrepreneur might look something like this:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) <a href="http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012/Unit/671001/Nugget/675002">http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012/Unit/671001/Nugget/675002</a></div>
<div>Web Fundamentals (CodeAcademy) <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web</a></div>
<div>Web Application Engineering (Udacity) <a href="http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012">http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012</a></div>
<div>Human Computer Interaction (Coursera) <a href="https://class.coursera.org/hci/class/index">https://class.coursera.org/hci/class/index</a></div>
<div>Creative, serious and playful science of Android Apps (Coursera) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101">https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101</a></div>
<div>Grow to greatness: Smart growth for private businesses (Coursera) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/growtogreatness">https://www.coursera.org/course/growtogreatness</a></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>During these courses the student would learn the basics of programming web applications, learn about user needs, build and test prototypes and turn the prototype to a real application. There should also be some more courses on how to run the business, but for now I only managed to find one on growth.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>Idea is to make a mashup of already existing free web courses from Coursera, Udacity, etc. to form a short curriculum which gives the student necessary skills to develop a web application and start running a small business</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>HCI course to find a relevant problem and design an elegant solution</li>
<li>Code Acadamy: html and CSS</li>
<li>Udacity: Python basics and Web application engineering</li>
<li>OpenIDEO to give a context or topic</li>
<li><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium;">Kickstarter for funding</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After taking the basic courses on technical skills, the students would participate to HCI course, the topic of which comes from OpenIDEO challenge</li>
<li>Benefits: </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; display: inline;">
<ul>
<li>Integrates already existing but a bit dispersed courses from different platforms to a neat package</li>
<li>More participants to OpenIDEO challenges. They are motivated by personal learning, but help solve some real problems. They also learn the necessary design skills as they go</li>
<li>The end result would be a big bunch of prototype web applications, some of which might even become a real business, with the help of Kickstarter or other crowdfunding solutions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Needed resources: Not much. Already build a prototype (This could be done on Weebly)</li>
<li>Could also be turned to a game, where each skill set is like levels: You're a level 1 programmer!</li>
<li>Companies could make them the requirement: "We're looking for someone, who can do these &lt;list of courses&gt;"</li>
</ul>
