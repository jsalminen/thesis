To the site. Plan is to evaluate at least some of the concepts. I saw an user stating, that one should first read trough all the concepts and then think about them, and evaluate all the concepts, but I don't think I want to do that. I just want to get something done. I'll start from the beginning and evaluate as many as I feel like.
<div><ul><li>I skimmed trough the list of unemployment challenge shortlisted concepts to get an overview of what kinds of concepts there are.</li><li>Evaluated Purpose workshops. Evaluation questions felt a bit confusing. Results are shown after I finish evaluation. Reminds me of Quirky pricing task.</li><li>Pressed back button on browser. The order of concepts was randomized when the page loaded. Evaluating the first one on the list</li><li>Evaluated Conference connecting young unemployed to future employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Evaluated OpenBus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>It seems to be one of those real projects, that is only partly developed on the site. Is the main thing that OpenIDEO does connecting the people who already work on the concepts? Then it just finds them and brings them together on a common platform. OpenIDEO would then just connect the disconnected, already existing innovations instead of creating new ones.</li><li>Evaluated OpenBus because it didn't have any evaluations yet</li></ul></li><li>Change my mind about the approach to evaluation. I'll evaluate those concepts with the least evaluations</li><li>Evaluated educationists + employers on the same page. It was long. Only skimmed trough and evaluated based on the first feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I don't remember exactly what was the brief. Bit too lazy to check, I still have the general impression.</li><li>Evaluated Subby. Didn't like it. I think LinkedIn and others already do the suggested tasks better. Found it somewhat difficult to be critical, though. Completely honest evaluation would probably have been negative evaluations on all aspects, but I gave a couple of mid-range evaluations just to cheer the submitter up. I was almost the only evaluator so far and all.</li><li>Evaluated Verified skills. I gave a positive evaluation, probably partly because my own concept was similar to this one. That similarity pushed a couple of evaluations up one notch.</li><li>Evaluated DIY Entrepreneur-loan. Most of the time I like an idea but prefer others. That's probably true for almost all shortlisted concepts. What are the others I prefer? Are they on the list at all? It's easy to go to middle range with the evaluations. Wonder how much this helps decision making.</li><li>Considered evaluating Startup Hostel, but concept is very long. Don't feel like reading it, and evaluating it without reading would be unfair. There's value propositions and all included.</li></ul></div></body></html>
