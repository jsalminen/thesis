REEAAAALLLYYY long time since I last visited the site. I saw an email some days ago announcing a new challenge. Better check that out. Also, maybe the unemployment challenge has also finished?
<div><ul><li>No, the unemployment challenge is still going on. The winners will be announced in seven days. That's way long evaluation period! Why so long? Did they have trouble arranging the meeting with the sponsor, or didn't they get enough evaluations?</li><li>Started following the new challenge called How might we identify and celebrate businesses that innovate for world benefit - and inspire other companies do the same?</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Only 174 followers so far</li></ul></li><li>Checking the challenge brief for celebrating businesses. There's no video :(</li><li>Now the missions make more sense. In inspiration phase they all have a big orange friendly button saying "Add your inspiration". Participating to the missions is now much easier. That was probably the missing piece in the mission puzzle</li><li>Wow, already 161 inspirations, and there's still 18 days left before the next phase starts!</li><li>Enough for now. Should take a look at inspirations tomorrow and post some myself, too.</li></ul></div></body></html>
