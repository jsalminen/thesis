<div>To the site</div>
<ul>
<li>Finding it difficult to motivate myself to visit the site</li>
<li>Was supposed to participate somehow to refinement phase, but there wasn't much going on around the concepts I was interested in, and the required tasks were dauntingly big and challenging considering the little time I've had lately. For instance, in e-waste challenge the most conceptes I would have liked to work on needed a business model. That's a major tasks!</li>
<li>E-waste challenge is now in evaluation phase</li>
<li>Youth employment challenge has still 18 hours in refinement</li>
<li>I'll do the evaluations soon. I feel too tired to concentrate at the moment. Would have to read trough the concept and figure out my opinion on several factors. (Am I biased thinking that OpenIDEO is a lot of work?)</li>
<li>Checked my contributions, too. There was one new positive comment.</li>
