Just checking what's going on at the site. It's late and I'm tired. Seems like I'm not going to contribute to refinement phase. The tasks that would have been needed to do (great sentence) were just too demanding at this point. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Filtering by themes works now. </li>
<li>How active the OpenIDEO site actually is? According to activity feed, the 10th last activity took place yesterday.</li>
<li>Come to think about it, yesterday I found many concepts that would need a business model. I could try my hand on it with the business model canvas tomorrow. That might be reasonably easy way to score positive comments, learn about the usability of the tool and participate to refinement.</li>
</ul>
