A month of almost daily visits to the site is over. I think I have an idea of how the site is supposed to work. Currently writing a description of the process at work. Just checking what's going on. From now on I will participate less strickly on a daily basis, but instead as I see fit as a user of the site.

<ul>
<li>My contributions has become the normal place to start my site visits.Â </li>
<li>Just found a virtual teams view on my profile site. There's nothing at the moment.</li>
<li>I read all the shortlisted concept trough yesterday. Now I'll try to figure out what are the ones I might have something to say. List below</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Toolbox of skills such as power point and excel. I think the resources for these are already available somewhere. Could make a prototype.</li>
<li>Verified skills academy is similar to my concept. Perhaps there's synergy</li>
<li>OpenIDEO: combination to Coursera course on Human computer interaction</li>
<li>Professionals as sometime teachers. Compare to team academy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'll start with these and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
