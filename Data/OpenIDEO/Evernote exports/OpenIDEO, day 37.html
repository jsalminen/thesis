To the site after almost a week of not participating. Had lack of motivation and lots of other things to do at work.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Read trough Verified skills academy concept. Some discussion has been going on, but not much progress, in my view. This would need a prototype next.</li>
<li>Checked the refinement instructions. It's a lot about visualization, clarification, mock-ups and prototypes</li>
<li>Read trough Toolbox concept. Not much to add to it. Seems like Lydia.com already covers much of it. Lydia is something I should take a look though. It offers some interesting courses.</li>
<li>Read trought OpenIDEO concept. Found out about a concept of connecting OpenIDEO and universities. OpenIDEO would provide winning concepts, which would then be prototyped at the university. Results would be posted to realisation phase.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There's also several discussion threads at the forum dedicated to OpenIDEO + universities connection</li>
<li>I'm not sure what would be the next step in development. Somehow combining OpenIDEO to classes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading about professionals as part time teachers. Still have the feeling that OpenIDEO is a lot of work. The tasks are rather ill-defined, and the user needs quite a lot of skills and personal commitment to participate. The user has to be active and figure out by himself how exactly to contribute.</li>
<li>I don't feel like I have much to contribute to none of these concepts expect the Verified Skills Academy. That would require a prototype, which might be in the limits of my skills. Have to consider it.<br/></li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the e-waste challenge shortlist. Maybe there are concepts which are easier to contribute to.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>This is a lot of work. Just reading trough the potential concepts takes time. What does more than sum of the parts feel like? I hope it doesn't feel like this. It's like everyone has to do a lot of work to get the understanding of the whole issue, and then understand the whole concept they're developing to contribute meaningfully.</li>
<li>Skimmed trough Mint for e-waste. What is required next is basically a business model. That's not a simple endeavor!</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Although could link to business model development sheet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking Golden e-waste concepts. It's very long, and as a next step this too basically requires a more honed business model and pitch to investors. That's a bit too much to ask.</li>
<li>Checking rewire concept. I'm getting somehow fed up with the platform. To contribute something, I would need to read trough many long concepts and discussions to find those I have skills and knowlege to participate. Then I would need to take up a serious challenge of figuring out a business model or something else very specific. Difficult to find the time and mental power for that. Also, it looks like there hasn't happened much since the announcement of shortlist. Is this typical? How much are concepts actually refined during the refinement phase?</li>
<li>Regenerate concept. Again issue is about refining business model. That's very difficult! I don't feel like taking up that kind of challenge. There's three days left, and the last comment is from OpenIDEO announcing the concept being on the shortlistâ€¦</li>
<li>Digital data transfer and elimination service. Again big tasks: doing a survey on user perceptions. Participating to refinement seriously requires real commitment. I would only do that if I was planning to turn the concept to my own business.</li>
<li>The Hacker's cookbook has seems to have a lot going on: there's been a workshop and update already. At this point I'm too bored to read it all trough, but I better check it out tomorrow.</li>
