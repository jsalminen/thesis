<ul>
<li>Surfing around the page</li>
<li>After all it might not be as big and complex as I initially thought</li>
<li>Field notes links to patterns and guest bloggers. I've seen the patterns page before, but haven't really figured it out yet. Very designish and fancy looking, but difficult to understand what's it about. Maybe check it out later. Anyway, they are linking to some relevant content elsewhere.</li>
<li>Looking for a challenge to participate to. Two options currenlty available, both nearing the end of concepting phase:</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgb(54, 54, 54); font-weight: bold; line-height: 16px;"><a href="http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/brief.html" title="View How can we manage e-waste &amp; discarded electronics to safeguard human health &amp; protect our environment?'s brief" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(0, 176, 216); text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;">How can we manage e-waste &amp; discarded electronics to safeguard human health &amp; protect our environment?</a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(54, 54, 54); font-weight: bold; line-height: 16px;"><a href="http://www.openideo.com/open/youth-employment/brief.html" title="View How can we equip young people with the skills, information and opportunities to succeed in the world of work?'s brief" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: rgb(0, 176, 216); word-wrap: break-word;">How can we equip young people with the skills, information and opportunities to succeed in the world of work?</a></span><br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whatched the challenge brief for the first one already yesterday. Checking out the second one</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Might be related to up and coming revolution in education, such as Udacity and Coursera.</li>
<li>After reading the brief, the issue is a bit larger: education is only a small piece of the puzzle</li>
<li>Might be an interesting challenge for real</li>
<li>The bad thing is it's already past the inspiration phase. Might have most to give in that part, with the help of extensive evernote clippings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking out the collaboration map</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Allows surfing around the concepts</li>
<li>I feel lost after just couple of clicks: Am I at the center? How far does this thing go? There's just too much stuff, and always more coming! Am I going in circles? How do I get to start. Confuses more than helps.</li>
<li>Ok, enough. One minute of clicking around and I'm overwhelmed. Just not my thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking out inspirations</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Inspiration phase has already concluded</li>
<li>Checked featured inspiration</li>
<li>The page is again a bit overwhelming. There's 6 challenge themes and 20 inspirations already on the first page. 353 total. I'm not going to look them all trough. Would take ages.</li>
<li>Bit confused about where to start. Should I look at the themes or just start from the top?</li>
<li>OpenIDEO seems to be quite a lot of work to participate. Just doing anything needs quite a lot of effort already in the start. The user needs to be really committed and ready to put some time on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Looked trough the descriptions of themes. Lots of "How might we…" questions. Sort of like dividing the problem to smaller pieces?</li>
<li>Looking trough inspirations</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There's many filtering options, but how do I know what I want? What is the best way to start? It feels like what ever I do, I'm going to end up missing the good ones!</li>
<li>Looking trough what there's in offer at default</li>
<li>Refreshed the page a couple of times. Same inspirations every time.</li>
<li>Inspirations are an important input. Bit like in radical innovation process, the information is flowing from environment to organization</li>
<li>Tried to applaud an inspiration. Terms and conditions jumped up. I accepted without reading a row.</li>
<li>Added a comment to same inspiration. Wonder how this affects my design quontinent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the briefing page there is a banner asking to check out the concept so far. So I check them out.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Read the featured concept</li>
<li>Scrolling through concepts and changing the filtering options</li>
<li>There's lots of pictures. About every concept has got a picture attached. Makes the site look lively. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making up a concept seems like a lot of work. I think I'm too tired today to try it. Will check out the submission form, though.<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Big, friendly green button says "Add your concept"</li>
<li>Form looks complete. Lots of space for information and attachements and clear format.</li>
<li>Challenge brief available at left. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div>Collaboration map. I don't really like these kinds of visualizations. Mainly gives an information overload, and I haven't yet figured out what might be a good way to use such a tool, beyond "gee, there's lots of stuff!"</div>

<div>Themes, filtering options and two first inspirations. How do I know how should I go on exploring them? Too many possibilities!</div>
