<li>During the day there was an announcement that Refinement would start in a few hours. Now it's been extended by 7 days, just as the other challenge. Is this a typical approach? Two deadlines for one phase? Or do they wait for some threshold of applause before making the decision? </li>
<li>Scrolling trough the fresh &amp; surprising list, opening interesting concepts and applauding good ones</li>

<li>Replied to comments on my own contribution. I gave feedback as per the rules of the site: remember to thank!. Then I solicited for suggestions to which concepts my idea might be combined to, as I have seen some similar suggestions being made in refinement phases of different challenges. I assume this is how things are done here, or at least they're supposed to be done. It's bit like finding a starting point on fitness landscape and then asking others for advice about to which direction to climb.</li>
<li>Applauded digital data transfer and elimination service</li>
<li>Applauded e-waste ambassadors, viral video</li>
<li>Applauded Stop outmoding and start upgrading. I'm jealous to all these concepts having 10+ or even 20+ applause.</li>
<li>Applauded neighborhood e-waste champion. I feel like I could start commenting more. </li>
<li>Applauded Gaming for e-waste behavior change. Because it mentioned games, was made by IDEO Palo Alto, and they used Brainstorm-in-a-box</li>
<li>Applauded Don't debate, granulate! The user clearly knows a lot about materials, and the explanation is looooooooong. Didn't read it.</li>
