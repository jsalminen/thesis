<ul>
<li>Checked the contribution: 78 views, 3 comments and 2 applause! Yeah!</li>
</ul>
<div>Afternoon, to the site again</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Scrolling through most applauded inspirations, opening interesting ones and bookmarking. The idea is to gather suitable pieces to build a concept</li>
<li>There's an one hour documentary about e-waste. I don't have time for this intensive participation. Trying to understand the whole issue is a lot of work!</li>
<li>Watching a YouTube video on Designed for the Dumb</li>
<li>Cradle to cradle, not that interesting</li>
<li>E-waste documentary is only 12 minutes. Might as well watch it</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I feel like I'm just scratching the surface of the issue. Properly contributing would take a lot of effort.Â </li>
<li>Interesting documentary. Explains some of the aspects of the issue pretty well</li>
<li>Applauded and bookmarked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applauded design for disassembly. It is actually a link outside the site. Many of the inspirations I've seen here are actually defining the problem.</li>
<li>Watching business logic of sustainability</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I feel like I just don't have the needed insights about this issue to make any meaningful contribution. Getting the understanding of the issue would take many youtube videos. A related talk on TED is about cradle to cradle design. This concept has been mentioned at least twice on OpenIDEO, but I don't have the time to watch it now.</li>
<li>Applauded the inspiration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking out some concepts, standard fresh &amp; surprising filter</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Funny, there's some concepts send by the Itau Unibanco, the challenge sponsor. This is new. It has made many concepts, 18 altogether. Looks like they are all from a brainstorming session or something. Checked some of the concepts. They were indeed generated in at least two separate brainstorming sessions.</li>
<li>Applauded E-waste bins for behavior change + awareness</li>
<li>Applauded Meet my laptop - her name is Emma</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking the most applauded concepts</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Applauded Encourage consumers bring back electronics with Deposit Program</li>
<li>Applauded Send old cell phones to recycling facilities in the boxes of their replacements. Based only on the headline and summary.</li>

<div>Metodology &amp; data collection</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Should collect data on the applause and evaluations of the concepts =&gt; Do applause, evaluations and winners correlate?</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>This should be done when applause phase has finished but the shortlist has not yet been annoucend. Being on shortlist will likely seriously bias the numbers: much more exposure, comments and applause.</li>
