Reflections
<div>
<ul>
<li>Might be possible to use the definition of collective intelligence by Woolley &amp; al. Innovation process requires the crowd to perform many diffenrent tasks</li>
<li>OpenIDEO has 7 full-time (?) facilitators + technical support. This sounds like a lot. Do other sites throw in this much employees?</li>
<li>OpenIDEO does the feedback very well. Got an response to my improvement suggestion in a matter of minutes. </li>
</ul>
<div>OpenIDEO site</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Considering adding the suggestion on bookmarking concepts / inspirations straight from the list view to the forum</li>
<li>Scrolling the forum. Apparently there's a mobile app version coming along</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Can't see anything similar on the first sight</li>
<li>Trying the search button</li>
<li>Saw a discussion on how people use the comments section on challenge briefs. Initiated by facilitator, already an year old, no replies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Posted the idea to user forum with as screenshot and replied to Ashley</li>
</ul>
<div>Time to post my first concept. It's going to need a bit honing and pictures outside the site.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Last possibiity. Evaluations start in 1 day</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the side panel says 2 days before the concepting ends. Who to believe here?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Noticed today's featured challenge: Interactive job map</li>
<li>Checked the most recent concepts. No-one still has scooped my idea</li>
<li>Checked the concept submission form</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Better check the challenge brief again. Handy reminder on the left side of the submission form reminded me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created and published the concept Curriculum Mashup. Created also a very quick prototype on Weebly. I'm feeling satisfied about myself. In my opinion it turned out to be quite nice. I even used many inspirations and a couple of concepts to build upon. </li>
<li>I'm a bit curious what kind of response my concept is going to get from the community. Expecting to see at least one positive comment, which according to one user should be practically guaranteed.</li>
<li>Few hours later went to check if anyone has noticed. Six views, no applause or comments.</li>
<li>Checked another time. 9 views.</li>
</ul>
<div>Collaboration map. This somehow tracks how the concepts are build: what are the parts. Might be possible to evaluate whether it is more than the sum of the parts...</div>
