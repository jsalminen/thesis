To the site. Considering how to develop my Tax concept based on the possibly synergic concepts suggested by Paul. My plan is to try to figure out how to combine some of the ideas described in Disassembly time tax refinement during applause phase -note to my concept. At least I can add the link to MicroTask blog post as a possible route to implementation.
<div><ul><li>Used post-it notes to figure out how these different pieces fit together</li><li>Took a picture and wrote a short update text explaining how different concepts fit together. I'm going to link almost all suggested concepts together with one simple strike.</li><li>Made an update to the concept. Turned out to be quite nice, with a new photo and all. Achievement of the day!</li><li>Posted a comment to comments section of my concept about the update.</li></ul></div></body></html>
