<div>Comment: Freaked out a bit by the fast response and suggestion to post the idea somewhere else.</div>
<div>Still, impressive speed. I guess this is part of the rule enforcing. It must be an immense amount of work!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Actually, I overreacted first. The message didn't mean I had posted it in a wrong place necessarily, but I could in addition post it there. It's my first task on OpenIDEO. Tasks are delegated to community, to reduce the amount of facilitation needed. </div>

<p>Hi Juho,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting in touch. We're always eager to hear new feature suggestions from our community!</p>
<p>We'll be sure to pass your insights on to our team. In the meantime, perhaps you'll consider posting your ideas to our User Forums under New Feature Suggestions? We try to keep track of everyone's suggestions there so that we have a running list to refer to in our development pipeline.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Currently to bookmark a concept or inspiration I have to click it open. It would be nice if I could do that also from the list view, just based on the headline and short summary.</p>
<p>Best,<br/>
Juho</p>
