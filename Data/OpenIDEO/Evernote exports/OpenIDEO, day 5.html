Read two papers on innovating at IDEO: Technology brokering and innovation in a product development firm and Brainstorming groups in context

There's just so much things I don't know about this topic or what has been going around on the site before. I would like to participate by making a concept, but I don't know where to start at this point. People seem to be already somewhat familiar with each other. I'm sort of an outsider. Maybe there's tips for newcomers?</li></ul></li><li>Community page</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Community page shows only top contributors on four different areas of design quontinent.

There's also something called Seasoned Users, whose task is to help newcomers on the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Not much discussion here.

I actually don't know yet the details. I guess each concept is owned by the submitter, and others can comment. Edits to the concept can be made by the owner only (?)</li><li>How important is it to be an extrovert to participate on this site? Just did a Myers-Briggs and maxed out on introvert score. "OpenIDEOers are a chatty bunch," say the instructions, and everyone have their pictures and names. Organizing things with friends is also encouraged. What if that kind of thing is not the most suitable way to work?</li><li>Read a lonely post about applause vs. evaluation.
