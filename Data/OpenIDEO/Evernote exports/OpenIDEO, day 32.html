The visits to the site will be less regular from now on. There was already a one day gap.

<div>Collected data on applause of e-waste challenge just before the shortlist is announced and refinement phase begins. It's still one hour to go before the refinement phase starts, and the applause has not officially finished yet, but I believe there will not be many applause coming in anymore.Â </div>

<div>I noticed an interesting phenomenon: The concepts submitted by organization (Itau in this case) get much less views, comments and applause than concepts submitted by real users. Now with hindsight, I think I also paid less attention to concepts from workshops, posted by organization instead of user with name and face. It seems to be important that users know they're interacting with a real person instead of faceless organization. Come to think about it, I guess comments from facilitators feel more personal than announcements from OpenIDEO, even if I suspect they actually are the same person(s).</div>
