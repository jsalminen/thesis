It's today's featured concept! Great success! This sort of feedback feels nice. The cynic on me still wonders whether it's a way to get new users hooked on the site. Giving positive feedback to users by featuring their concepts just to motivate them might be more important than possible biases in evaluation due to uneven exposure to concepts. There's a decision committee going trough all the concepts, anyway.</li></ul><div>Giving some applause and possibly comments, too</div><div><ul><li>Fresh and surprising filter, just looking trough the list and opening the interesting ones, or applauding directly from the list</li><li>Applauded Millenial Alley.
