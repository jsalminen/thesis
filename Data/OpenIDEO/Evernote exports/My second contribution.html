Recycling tax on electronics based on the time it takes to recycle the device
<div><br/></div>
<div>Separating toxic parts from normal materials, such as plastic covers, is often difficult and time consuming. Electronic devices could be taxed based on the time it takes to separate parts containing toxics from the rest.Â </div>

<ul>
<li>Incentive for companies to design easily recyclable devices</li>
<li>Tax could be a fixed tax times the time in seconds it takes to disassemble the device. Well-designed modular devices could avoid the tax almost completely. At the same time the modularity might make the production of devices easier, thus providing the companies cost savings.</li>
