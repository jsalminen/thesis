<ul>
<li>Trying to figure out what exactly is the problem. Is it the design of products? Legal incentives? Consumers? Companies?</li>
<li>Maybe the themes make figuring out the exact problem easier. Is that the purpose of themes? Breaking the problem to smaller sub-problems?<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Make the business case is the most interesting theme for me. Checking the concepts under that theme.</li>
<li>There's none. Seems like people are not using the themes to organize the concepts. None of the theme filters provides any answers. Or maybe the functionality just doesn't work. My own concept has a theme, but it's still not showing up in corresponding theme. Shouldn't be a browser clitch, as it doesn't work on Safari either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checked out the inspirations again. There the themes and missions work as filters. One of the missions was hosting an interview. Only one of the facilitators had done it. The results were presented in the blog.</li>
<li>Figured out a possible concept by thinking about the problem and some of the inspirations I saw yesterday.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Tax on electronic products based on the time it takes to disassemble them for recycling. A modular design, where the toxic parts are easily removed from covering plastics would be fastest to disassmble. The same structure would probably be also easy to assemble, thus providing savings to producers. Tax could be calculated as a constant amount of money per second it takes to disassemble the product for recycling</li>
<li>Posting the concept this late will not give anyone opportunities to build on my concept. That's a shame. Should be posting concepts earlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uploaded a concept to E-Waste challenge: Disassembly time tax. Just in time, as there's only one day left before applause phase starts...</li>
