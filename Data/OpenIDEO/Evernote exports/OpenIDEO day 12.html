<ul>
<li>I've got my first applause and comment! 30 views now.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Comment from Meena Kandri, a facilitator. Positive feedback on leveraging existing networks and prototype. Nice, although I know they say that to pretty much anyone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applause will start in 5 hours. Will be waiting for that.</li>
<li>Afternoon. Applause phase has not started yet. It will last for eight days. There's nice, short descriptions of the purpose of each phase below the process chart</li>
<li>Evening. Now it's saying again 4 hours before Applause starts.Â </li>
</ul>
<div>Waiting for the applause phase to start and reading the challenge report New opportunities for urban sanitation</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Starts with thorough and insightful problem description, including profiles of three people from the target market</li>
<li>Explanation on how this IDEO project and efforts of OpenIDEO community worked together. Smart stuff! The task of the OpenIDEO community was to "While the IDEO project team worked on the product and service delivery of new sanitation solutions, the OpenIDEO community expand the focus to include a broader range of issues from awareness to treatment"</li>
<li>Presentation of challenge themes under Process topic. Adding nuances to problem definition</li>
<li>Examples of inspirations from OpenIDEO community: Green diaper collection service, The X-runner, I know it's clean because it smells like...</li>
<li>More description of the problem under the topic Insights</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Sanitation in Ghana is complex</li>
<li>Public toilets are for public places</li>
<li>In-home sanitation is nothing new, but many are now illegal</li>
<li>Pee and poo are different</li>
<li>The compound is the home, and it's almost always rented</li>
<li>Ownership = care</li>
<li>Bugs are dirty, germs are invisible</li>
<li>Etc., etc. Lots of insights on the problem!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 design principles .Design principles are actually a concise problem definition</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Convenience, convenience, convenience</li>
<li>Pay over time</li>
<li>Make the right choice the easy choice</li>
<li>Connect the dots</li>
<li>Work with what works</li>
<li>Incentivize private sector involvement</li>
<li>#2 is the new #1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This really is good stuff, although the role of OpenIDEO seems minimal so far.</li>
<li>Opportunities</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Preliminary ideas for solutions, I guess?</li>
<li>Two pages of awareness related concepts from OpenIDEO presented. They will be used to inform future prototyping</li>
<li>Opportunity 1: High touch service toilet. OpenIDEO concepts are presented along the way as partial solutions</li>
<li>Opportunity 2: A sister idea. OpenIDEO concepts again. PeePoo version 2 refers to flying toilet behavior. There has clearly been interaction between the field team and OpenIDEO during the process. Flying toilets are very specific information from the field, which is not normally available outside Ghana</li>
<li>Opportunity 3: All-in-one VIP. The concept from OpenIDEO is not very special. Featuring only for marketing purposes? Winning concepts announcement mentioned that the community came up with many of the same ideas as the IDEO team. What exactly is the value added?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treatment</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Begins with ideas from OpenIDEO</li>
<li>Value of OpenIDEO might be in enriching the content of the report with fresh ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next steps</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Talking about prototyping and small scale pilot to find out what works. Kind of like idea evaluation.</li>
<li>Short descriptions on next steps: what needs to be discovered and what needs to be done</li>

<li>Background information on sanitation in Kumasi, with an additional OpenIDEO concept and an advertisement for the site</li>

<div>Thoughts on analysis</div>
<div>Could start the analysis by looking at the following topics:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Rules of the site</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Innovation process</li>
<li>Crowdsourcing process</li>
<li>Inputs</li>
<li>Outputs</li>
</ul>
<div>These aspects cover most of the bubbles in collective intelligence framework of the study; only distributed memory is not directly touched.</div>
