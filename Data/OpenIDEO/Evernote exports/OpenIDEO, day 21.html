Analysing the tasks during the innovation process
<div><ul><li>Missions fit very well to descriptions of problem identification phase in IDEO HCD toolkit. However, they are a bit hidden in the side panel and feel much like suggestions. It's like if they are some added extra: If I did them, where would I post them? Inspirations, of course, but they just don't feel like fitting exactly. There seems to be a disconnection on the platform on this aspect. Or maybe it's just me.</li><li><b>Brainstorm in a box. Should have used it!</b> This is definitely something to test in the next challenge after the pilot.</li><li>During the refinement phase many comments suggest the owners of the concepts to check out other, related concepts and to include or combine them</li><li>Themes: how are they used? There's instructions somewhere on the site, check 'em!</li><li><b>Synthesis meeting</b> between Inspiration and Concepting phases!!</li><li>Are missions and themes actually tasks? Missions for Inspiration and Themes for Concepting?</li><li>Make a list comparing the missions across all the challenges</li></ul><div>Busy day and felt tired in the evening. Did not really participate on the site today.</div></div></body></html>
