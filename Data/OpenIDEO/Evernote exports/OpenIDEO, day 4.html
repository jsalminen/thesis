<ul>
<li>OpenIDEO advertises it's featured concepts on Twitter. How does this affect evaluation? At least it reduces independence and biases the decision making towards the featured concepts. Converging to a solution too early? Compare to the article about searching the high peak on random two-peak landscape formed of numbers from 1-100</li>
</ul>
<div>To the site</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Checking out "amazing OpenIDEO and IDEO.org Impact story from our Sanitation challenge with Unilever and Ghana. 25 homes in Accra now boast Clean Team toilets and sanitation service."</li>
<li>Wathcing the video about the story</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Well produced, with soudtrack and all!</li>
<li>"Going out to toilet at night is dangerous, anything can happen" =&gt; Happiness is own toilet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading trough the story how it was done. Am I doing this only because of SuperCrowdsource project or would I read it anyway? Data collection changes the user experience somewhat. I guess I would skim trough the story if I was doing this "for real", but now I end up reading it twice because of coding on Dedoose.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Who are the people building the toilets and who's paying them? Is it all just an elaborate marketing scheme for Unilever?</li>
<li>The implementation requires some serious resources. Is it the same in all cases?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's a new concept at the top of the page, AD.D.ED. Front page is dynamic, after all, giving exposure to new entries instead of old an popular by default.</li>
<li>Filter concepts with "Recent" on top</li>
<li>Applauded Multiple paths to diploma, just based on the short intro. Reminds me of Udacity &amp; co.</li>
<li>Checking inspiration. Maybe I can find something good to start building my own concept. Also, should check out what was asked in the form again.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There's more filtering options for inspirations than for concepts: View by, Missions and Themes. What are missions?</li>
<li>Sir Ken Robinson's TED talk and Jamie Oliver's restaurant using unemployed people are on top of the most applauded list. Somehow I'm biased towards thinking about web based education as a solution</li>
<li>Looking trough the inspirations at topic level to see if there's a pattern.</li>
<li>Applauded How a teapot and twitter got me a job offer after graduating. Great story!</li>
<li>There's many examples of online education: Coursera, edX, Udacity, Learn to Code, etc.</li>
<li>Other patterns I can quickly grasp might be attitude, entrepreneurship, design thinking, internships, self-knowledge, social skills</li>
<li>Looking trough the inspirations and properly harvesting them for insights would take some serious effort. Should I instead just skim trough them or read some of the thoroughly at random? That decision is left for user to do.</li>
<li>Least applauded page has clearly less pictures than the front page. How important is the presentation here? Photos and videos are encouraged in the instructions.</li>
<li>Found the missions on the left panel of Inspirations site. Still don't really understand them. How do they differ from Themes?</li>
<li>Found the OpenStorms. It's probably an IDEO thing after all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People on OpenIDEO are not just random people. Just picked an user at random to check the profile. Behold! A design researcher, who has been featured at HCD toolkit before. (Kara Pecknold)</li>
<li>Found an framework of themes, which is supposed to help in concepting. This seems useful for understanding the context and what is the big picture. Just wondering what is the mechanism that turn individual contributions to a bigger picture, instead of just a list of separate interesting things. Is it the job of facilitators, or does the platform support it somehow?</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>How might we questions have a big role here. I haven't thought about them that much before. Maybe I should.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking out the concept form</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Linking to other concepts seems to be most easy trough using the bookmarks function on the site. Alternatively I could search for the ones that gave me inspiration. What is the real purpose of linking? Building a nice graph for concept map, giving credit or what? Does it also serve developing better concepts? Maybe directing users to the concept in evaluation phase?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So far I have mostly only been lurking around the site without really participating. I sure can applaud, but otherwise the threshold for participating feels highish</li>
</ul>
<div>Reflection</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>General feel of the site is happy optimism and "we can do it!" attitude. Is this an important part of the rules of engagement?</li>
<li>Might OpenIDEO be an extension of organizational memory/ technology brokering functions described in Hargadon &amp; Sutton: Technology brokering article?</li>
</ul>
