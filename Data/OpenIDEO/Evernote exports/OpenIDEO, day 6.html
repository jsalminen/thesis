<ul>
<li>"Results of relevant OpenIDEO challenges might be useful material for some development projects around Lahti, too.</li>
<li>Might be a good idea to give a try to SuperBetter for comparison</li>
</ul>
<div>To the OpenIDEO site</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Decided to look trough inspirations one by one. There's a next/previous buttons on detailed view. I remember this from the previous visit.</li>
</ul>
Clicking the challenge from the front page redirects to the current phase of the challenge: Concepting<br/>
<ul>
<li>Filtering inspirations by applauds, going trough from the top</li>
<li>Jamie Oliver's fifteen. Pretty impressive. Why isn't school like that?</li>
<li>Ken Robinson TED-talk I've already seen. Skip.</li>
<li>Reverse mentorship. Again interesting concept. Reminds me of the Swiss project, where teenagers teach elderly to use computers. Noticed that this one belongs to Mission 4: Employer's viewpoint. Missions are starting to make a bit sense now. They are sort of tasks, given OpenIDEO style indirectly: " We would love to hear from employers and businesses about your perspective on the challenge of equipping young people for work. " Aim seems to be to define the problem further:  "What have been some of your own hurdles and successes in working with young people? What challenges do you face in recruiting and training young people in your business? What support have you tapped into or felt lacking?"</li>
<li>All work is honorable (and we shouldn't be afraid of that). Combination of a story and suggestion for change of attitude. Reading trough inspirations might actually be a good way to get accustomed to the problem. Watching the attached video now.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Video was about appreciation of craftsmanjobs such as plumbing, welding, etc.</li>
<li>Watched also one episode of Dirty Jobs on YouTube. The episode was about digging up a 5 meter cactus and planting it elsewhere by hand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe I could collect the essence of each inspiration on post-it notes and use that to figure out patterns on my own. </li>
<li>TruApp - Showcasing skills</li>
<li>TED-talk on reality-based education, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=NMr3ShT_Kl4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NMr3ShT_Kl4</a></li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Studio Schools, an alternative for sitting in a classroom but doing things for real, with others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting hat ala Harry Potter. Watching the scene from the movie</li>
<li>Learning by doing</li>
<li>Design thinking for educators - IDEO:s toolkit for teachers</li>
<li>How teapot and twitter got me a job. I saw this already earlier.</li>
<li>Khan Academy</li>
<li>Fake it till you make it: storytelling and attitudes</li>
<li>Coursera. Might check out when the new courses are starting</li>
<li>AIESEC - watching the video, too. Familiar from the University, but did not participate. Maybe should have.</li>
<li>BUILD: high school entrepreneurs. New type of schooling again. Not very well formulated inspiration, I would need to check the website to understand, but don't feel like it. TIme for coffee.</li>
</ul>
<div>Reading a paper Stigmergic self-organization and improvisation of Ushahidi</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Multiple viewpoints for analysis is a great idea.</li>
<li>Must build data displays!! Thousands of them!</li>
<li>Virtual organization might be a relevant viewpoint, too</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Virtual organizations maintain their structure without sharing a physical space.</li>
<li>Virtual organizations use computer-mediated communication <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">to function (Cogburn, 2011).</span><br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font face="Helvetica">Discussion on usefulness of maps as a basis for collaboration: maybe this is the reason for collaboration (or concept) map on OpenIDEO? The implementation could be better, though.</font></li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li><font face="Helvetica">Getting data in Dedoose: currently I clip web pages to evernote, copypaste the content to Word document, save, and upload to Dedoose. This process only accepts web clips of certain width. Too wide clips are just messed up after pasting to Word.</font></li>
<li><font face="Helvetica">It also seems like Dedoose will not render landscape documents correctly.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font face="Helvetica">Coding has been somewhat inconsistent, and I probably should redefine the codes and do it all again, after I have some more data and have done some preliminary analyses. Would also be a good idea to print the definitions and keep them at hand while coding, as suggested by Miles &amp; Huberman.</font></li>
