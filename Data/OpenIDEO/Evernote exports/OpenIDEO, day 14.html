Standard filters.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Feeling bored already. What would be the best way to go about applauding? Should I just scroll down the list as I've done now, or open the concepts and read the through? Nothing on the front page really feels interesting.</li><li>Applauded the Uninternship. Have seen it before, roughly remember what it is about: videos showcasing what different jobs are really about</li><li>Partly decided not to applaud, because a concept already got 10 and I was jealous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>It's hard to resist looking at the number of applauds, and after I do, I feel that number has an effect on my decision</li><li>Scrolled through and applauded 1001 ways to success: decision making is fun!</li><li>Applauded Bootstrapped design thinking workshop to lauch an innovative business. There's apparently a virtual design thinking course offered by D.school, which I didn't know about. Nice! I feel like I should comment on this, but I don't really have that much to say about it.</li><li>Applauded TryMe, because there's a professional grade video. Probably an already existing service, but I appreciate the effort.</li><li>Applauded Career+ Hangouts, because it uses new technology. Otherwise didn't really get the idea. I'm tired and don't really care anymore.</li><li>Checked out the most applauded. Top position is held by Startup Pirates with 34 applause. More than ten is already quite a lot.</li></ul></li></ul><div>Analysis</div><div><ul><li>Trying to make a framework of the rules with post-it notes. Data used does not include comments; mostly blogs, challenge briefs and official instructions + some instructions by users on the forum, and my own reflections on the diary. Idea is to make a framework of what categories of rules there might be. I believe I have sufficient amount of data (about 300 web clips) to form the categories, even if I haven't got all the rules yet. The specific rules I found later, for example from comments, can then be used to expand and validate the initial framework.</li><li>Note: Legal rules is one important class of rules, but I left it out of the post-it analysis, as the legal rules are explicitly stated on the site and easy to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Rules were gathered from the data as follows:</li></ul><ol><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ol><li>Code the data</li><li>Extract excerpts with code "Rules". Rule was understood broadly, including both explicit (guiding principles) and implicit rules ("We're a chatty bunch at OpenIDEO)</li><li>Print excerpts</li><li>Read trough and underline the rules</li><li>Write the essence of rules to post-it notes</li><li>Organize notes</li><li>Name emergent categories</li></ol></li></ol><div><ul><li><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Tahoma; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium;">Ended up with pretty neat categorization</span></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
