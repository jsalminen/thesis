Watching TEDx-talk about Vibrant Cities challenge on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEJdcx2Otas&amp;feature=youtu.be<br/>
<ul>
<li>About 350 viewers so far. Not very viral video</li>
<li>Designer talking. Not sure how he's related to OpenIDEO… ok, he works on IDEO</li>
<li>Competition or collaboration?</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Combining collaboration and competition!</li>
<li>For example Open Source communities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
OpenIDEO = open sourcing innovation process<br/>
<ul>
<li>Design Thinking, how human centered design get done</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Mindset anyone can apply to problem solving</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Premise: Why not create massive teams of people working on these problems</li>
</ul>
Challenges<br/>
<ul>
<li>Like projects, always backed with an organization<br/></li>
<li>Aimed at big social problems<br/></li>
<li>Community starts by sharing stories<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Emphasising context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like a timeline</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

<li>"Collective intelligence" mentioned shortly</li>

Outputs: two examples of winning concepts<br/>
<ul>
<li>Decode the codes<br/></li>
<li>CityAPI<br/></li>
<li>Venture for America<br/></li>

<div>Tools for smart competition</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>"Like Pacman, only changing the interface, people still want compete"</li>
<li>"We have to change both context and create right conditions =&gt; combining need to compete with smart collaboration tools"</li>
<li>Gaia hypothesis, reference to global brain</li>
</ul>
<div>At OpenIDEO website again</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Was wondering about the community rules. Found the link, they are actually just these four principles:</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Inclusive</li>
<li>Community-centered</li>
<li>Optimistic</li>
<li>Always in Beta</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking out user forums</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't seem to have that much content, considering there's more than 30 000 participants. See web clip</li>
<li>Forum definitely not the active part of the site. Latest comment is already 7 days old, and the third newest comment is behind a month. Clipped the listing of recent comments.</li>
</ul>
<div>Working on challenge brief about getting young unemployed people to work</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>They said even little participation, such as applauding is enough. I will participate a little today to get a hang of how this thing works</li>
<li>Clipped the front page of Concepting. I've been wondering whether the front page stays about the same for the whole time. At least the page seems to be generated deterministically =&gt; Assuming people don't use filters very actively, all participants are going to see about the same concepts. At least the concepts on the front page are going to get significantly more exposure. This might bias the decision making, evaluation and further development of concepts in favor of those which happened to get to the front page in the first place. This could also be a positive feedback loop increasing the popularity of popular concepts. This depends of course on which filters are used on the site by default</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Filters are Fresh &amp; Surprising and All</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking the first concept on the list, "The collective-work-pedia which erradicates myopia"</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I didn't really get it. Have to admit, I read it trough very sloppily.</li>
<li>Wondering whether I should comment or applaud anyway, as I already invested some time on the concept? It's sort of wasted if I don't do anything.</li>
<li>Don't feel like contributing to this one, so I won't</li>
<li>There's functionality to move to next concept from the concept view. Clicking away…</li>
<li>Applauded Work Experience Time Banking concept. Apparently it builds on an inspiration on earlier phase. There's some continuity here</li>
<li>Just noticed there's a bunch of links to learning resources on the site, including Challenge brief, guiding principles, Exploring themes for connecting and Brainstorm in a box. Better check it out later</li>
<li>Also, just realized this is concepting phase and there's not much time left. I should probably try and come up with a concept. Totally out of ideas at the moment, though…</li>
<li>Applauded The great employer register concept based on the two line introduction. </li>
<li>Applause phase starts in 8 days. I guess I should focus much more on trying to figure out a concept or improving existing ones instead of applauding now. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Back to concept listing. I take my word back. Apart from the top three, The Fresh &amp; Surprising listing seems to be changing every page load. Clipped a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There's actually only 581 people following this challenge. The number of active participants per challenge is probably quite small after all. Definitely not measured in thousands.</li>
<li>Applauded today's featured concept Testing grounds. It's got 135 views. 11 comments and 4 applauds. Are these numbers typical?</li>
<li>Most viewed concept has 808 views, 28 comments and 12 applauds at this point</li>
<li>Second on the most viewed list is Startup Pirates. This is actually an existing website and concept. Free promotion for own organization trough crowdsourcing site? Address is <a href="http://www.startuppirates.org/">http://www.startuppirates.org/</a>. This is actually the most applauded concept.This is actually a fully working organization with lots of sponsors and events.</li>
</ul>
