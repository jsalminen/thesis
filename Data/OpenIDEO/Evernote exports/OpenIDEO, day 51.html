To the site. Browsing Inspirations starting from the oldest. Idea is to applaud, open and perhaps even comment interesting ones.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Applauded a TED-talk about carpet factory. Had seen this in previous challenge. Good stuff, especially for this challenge.</li>
<li>Applauded You can change what you measure</li>
<li>Applauded Pirate version of top 100 companies. Liked the upside down -approach</li>
<li>These were just the first 20 of 385 inspirations, and I'm only looking at the headlines. No way I'm going to go through all of them! Switching to Fresh &amp; surprising filter.</li>
<li>OpenIDEO site crashed. </li>
</ul>
<div>Another try in the evening. Fresh &amp; surprising, will go as far as I can.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Applauded the X Prize</li>
<li>Applauded "You ain't seen nothing yet". Bit weird, was the first reaction, but still I liked it.</li>
<li>Applauded GE Healthcare. That's according to specifications of the mission.</li>
<li>Applauded Who made the difference. That's some sort of prize, and that was asked for in one of the missions.</li>
<li>Applauded Kiva</li>
<li>Applauded World car awards. Again, this kind of inspirations were requested.</li>
<li>After browsing through 160 inspirations I don't really care anymore. Barely looking at the pictures.</li>
<li>Applauded Eyecare and microfrancise</li>
<li>Just realized I'm barely half-way through. Enough for now. </li>
<li>Checked out Making the world a better place, because the image reminded me of Anonymous. Lots of text in small font. Doesn't look interesting, not going to read or applaud.</li>
<li>Checked out Who made the difference. Looked like interesting inspiration, but it seems to be a concept someone posted too early. As such not interesting, as it hasn't been proven to work.</li>
<li>Watched RSA Animate: First as tragedy, then as farce. It was a featured inspiration. Not sure if I should applaude. Didn't like the talk that much, but the viewpoint was nice, because it was kinda against the whole challenge. I'm applauding that.</li>
</ul>
