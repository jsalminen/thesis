New phase of innovation process: Team building / recruitment?
<div>
<ul>
<li>Woke up with this idea in my head: There seems to be an implicit phase in innovation process, which at least I have so far ignored: team bulding or recruitmen</li>
<li>Most often repeated task (intuition, haven't really counted) on OpenIDEO is join the conversation, in other words recruiting participants</li>
<li>Even users try to recruit each other</li>
<li>There's also the virtual teams</li>
<li>According to Valve guide, recruitment is their most important task: they recruit only more capable people than the current employees. Their whole approach to innovation is based on this</li>
<li>Rainmaker index is one example of tools for recruiting capable individuals</li>

Reading throught the concepts suggested by Paul<br/>
<ul>
<li> Rewire.com. Applauded it halfway trough<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Reading the discussions. Really good stuff here. Paul has apparently been really active. He's been making mental maps of at least one challenge, and made a webiste based on some of the concepts of OpenIDEO development challenge. These are good for estimating outputs of the site.</li>
<li>Opening a new note to collect the pieces of the puzzle about all these ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Environmental rating. Good pictures. This is correct use of inspirations: they are copypaste of similar ratings, but in different contexts.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Come to think about it, the OpenIDEO approach kind of reduces the amount of work I have to do to develop the concept. I can offload some of the work to the community, which will search for inspirations for me. Other participants can also point help me in developing the concept. I save time, when active users like Paul tell me what concepts to read. I don't have to go trough all of them by myself.</li>
<li>While reading trough the concept I realized a simple improvement to my concept: I could just add a link to MicroTasks post on Open Government and suggest that as the first step.</li>
<li>OpenIDEO approach may indeed be smart, even though for some reason I feel sceptical about it (=it could be done better). I can sort of generate an idea and improve a concept without using that much my brain power. I'll just check out the concepts that are suggested to me and combine them if I can easily figure out a way, without really caring about anything else.</li>
<li>The feedback given to the user about the concept is immensely important. I've now spend a couple of hours more thinking about my concept after I got just a couple of positive comments with clues on what to do next. The other concept I don't even bother considering. Without the feedback I definitely wouldn' t be working on this on Sunday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recy-cool-ability. It's massively looooong! And there's a lots of comments, too!</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I'm just skimming trough. Too much details, and I'm getting caffeine withdrawal symptoms</li>
<li>There's a prototype website allready! How much are these people putting effort on the site!?! Actually, a wrong alert. That was just a suggested hostname, or the site is maybe down for maintenance. </li>
<li>Good questions for further consideration. That gives people easier changes to participate. </li>
<li>Paul clearly aims to develop this concept further on his own. Talks about building a prototype on freely hosted site and asks people to join the team</li>
