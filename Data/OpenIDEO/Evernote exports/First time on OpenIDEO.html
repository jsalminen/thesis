<li>Formulation in a challenge format: "Join us in a challenge"</li>
<li>Somehow personal and "do-it-yourself" -feel to the video: not too fancy, messy background etc.</li>

</ul>
<div>Thoughts this far:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is a business model: OpenIDEO facilitates innovation process, the sponsor pays the costs and community does the work</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Checked the currents on the front page, see Currents 74 on Evernote</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>35325 users! Last time I checked the site it was around 18 000. The size is crowing nicely.<br/></li>
<li>News feed seems to promote active community members on regular basis under the term OpenIdeator. Stylish photos and short interviews</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checked the challenges in realization</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Question is in "How might we…" form. Familiar from IDEO HCD Toolkit</li>
<li>Process description with the current phase and numerical measurements is clear, bright and colorful and immediately noticeable on the top of the page. Gives a lot of information to the user, fast and easy.</li>
<li>Realization is the last phase of the process</li>
<li>There's stories of implementations resulting from the challenge. For Vibrant Cities challenge there's now two, and the first one even gives a link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEJdcx2Otas&amp;feature=youtu.be">TEDx-talk</a>. Better check it out soon.</li>
<li>I'm wondering what the sponsor is doing with the results. This seems to be just some community member deciding to work on his own? Still great to have that influence, but what did the sponsor get out of it all?</li>
<li>Realization stories will be good material for research. Should collect them all.</li>
<li>Sponsor was Steelcase, but there's nowhere a mention on what they did with the results, not even a comment</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Challenges</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nice listing of challenges and their current phase, with sponsor logos, on the challenge site</li>
<li>Challenge brief, check related note</li>
</ul>
<div>Read challenge brief for e-waste</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There's really much information to be found and a bit overwhelming amount of links. Feels like it's going to take long time before I get to do anything useful.</li>
<li>No description of the task yet, or at least not as specific as I was expecting. Checking out Guiding Principles next. Maybe that will give more directions.</li>
</ul>
