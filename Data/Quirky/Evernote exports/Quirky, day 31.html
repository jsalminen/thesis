I'm getting way too many push-notifications and emails from Quirky. Removing the notifications from iPhone.
<div>I'm not clipping idea submissions or product development timelines anymore. I don't think they provide new information on the process anymore. Still check them, but clip only if there's something new. Overall I'll just do tasks quickly as I would as a real user, and focus data collection on areas I don't have much data yet. Should check the forums, for example.<br/>

<li>Apparently had done voting already. Did 40 more.</li>

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Can't do this on iPhone. Technically could, but I cannot check the product details, so it's difficult to give any knowledgeable answers to research questions.</li>
<li>Ended up watching brainstorm record on this</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Discussing about possible use cases</li>
<li>Designer is drawing &amp; writing on a mind map</li>
<li>Comments &amp; questions from chat</li>
<li>Discussing about technological solutions, how this could be done</li>
<li>Use cases again. Could also be called problem definition, or what problem the product should solve. This is now interpretation.</li>
<li>Little comment from chat.</li>
<li>13:36 min in total</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Answered research questions. No Innovators questions this time. </li>

<div>
<ul>
<li>This one has more specific questions straight from the inventor</li>
<li>Replied 'Other' to one of the questions, but changed it to one of the real alternatives after seeing they would have wanted written explanation. Easier this way. </li>
<li>Inventor questions are often a bit weird. Or rather, formulated in a such way that they do not give much information to the inventor.</li>

<li>Watching Eval recording</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>2083 exposures, 665 views, 592 votes and 73 comments</li>
<li>It might be possible to collect some data on these numbers. Difficult, but possible. Perhaps not worth the hassle, because I cannot get data on ideas that were not selected</li>
<li>"76 % of community like it so we go to community!" Asking community opinion from Berend</li>
<li>Then rapid fire with experts</li>
<li>One of the experts wanted to know how much community would pay for it. They have functionality to do that live during the Eval. Price shown on screen in real time, while audience comments</li>
<li>50/50 vote. Community decides. If more than 50 % of community like it in the end of count down, they will make it. Pie chart locked to more than 50 %. Decided to make it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Answered the questions.</li>
</ul>
<div>Still only one comment on my sensor design. It's still cute. I hope Quirky notices it. It's now one of 133 designs.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking a couple ideas. Evaluation is always necessary, and I got my 15 votes of the day.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>First world problems comes to mind when reading some of these ideas.</li>
<li>Voted for digital sticky notes. That would be way cool! Wanted to comment, too, but didn't come up with a good comment. </li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Commented after all</li>
