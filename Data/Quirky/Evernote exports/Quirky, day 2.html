Quick visit to the site in the evening.
<div>
<ul>
<li>I've got influence! My influence on Sandpaper Sticks is 0.00601 %</li>
<li>Going to participate, to see how I can participate. Design phase for Sandpaper Sticks is still on. </li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>The quality of submissions seems to be generally very low. "Ergonomic handle". Yeah, that would be nice. But what exactly is the shape? </li>
<li>Quirky seems to have much less emphasis on discussion and collaboration compared to OpenIDEO. Clipped a couple of most active discussions. Seven comments was the highest number, and comments were generally very short.</li>
<li>Voted Q-tip style. Not sure why. It felt better than the most suggestions. Tells something about the quality…</li>
<li>First impression is that the average participant is definitely not a designer. Current guess is that the education level of participants is lower than on OpenIDEO</li>
<li>"Add a magnifying lens" suggested as a design feature. Da fuck?</li>
<li>The effort put on the design suggestions is not very high.</li>
<li>I find it difficult to find anything worth my third vote</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User profiles have a lot of information, for example the number of ideas submitted, the influence they have had on the products, the amount of money they have earned. A random user I found has influenced 84 products, but hasn't earned yet any money. Is this typical?</li>
<li>Ben Kaufman, Creative director (?) of Quirky has earned trough the site a bit over $5000. </li>
<li>Watching the instructions for submitting ideas. It's the same video as I've seen elsewhere.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>The video and sidepanel mention community. But where is it? How do I engage with the community? Haven't seen even a forum on the site. I guess the Quirky community is not as chatty bunch as OpenIDEO community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Quirky process seems very similar to OpenIDEO</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>The submission form is more thorough, and there's no inspiration phase. Submission form has three steps. I better check out what they are at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Number of ideas under consideration is huge! How do they manage these numbers? First guess is around hundred or so. And this means shortlist.</li>
</ul>
