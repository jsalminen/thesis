Watching interview of 12 time inventor
<div>
<ul>
<li>Creating products alone is a hassle</li>
<li>On Quirky you just send idea and they take care of it</li>
<li>Very short video. Just an advertisement basically</li>
</ul>
<div>Watching Gin with… Steven Shaw</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Interview of head of community</li>
<li>Online communities mostly about digital stuff</li>
<li>Managing Quirky community different from others</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Community doesn't really listen the head</li>
<li>Job is to be stuart, advocate of community</li>
<li>Influence! Only known community, where influence generates money. Different challenge</li>
<li>Community is building stuff instead of talking about building stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes to platform?</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Community is the brand</li>
<li>All brand meeting have been about community: how to grow it &amp; reach other communities</li>
<li>At the moment bias towards people who spend a lot of time on it</li>
<li>Going towards making early touch points easier</li>
<li>Ebay: easy default vs. power user interface. Now emphasis on simple part for Quirky. But also power users must be serviced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People can ask questions on chat</li>
<li>Increasing the head of the pyramid (deeply invested users) by community management tools (instead of raw numbers, which are for marketing)</li>
<li>jim@quirky.com: ideas about platform!!</li>
<li>Not users, but community members.</li>
<li>Web-feature influence is not on the roadmap (Influence from development of the platform)</li>
<li>Scaling of influence with company growth?</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Being ideator will be worth more</li>
<li>Small tasks could be worth less</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biggest question they get: $10 idea submission fee</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Quirky in business of making products, not in collecting idea fees. They don't like it.</li>
<li>Used to prevent the avalanche of mediocre ideas</li>
<li>Avalanche seen when they offer free idea submissions</li>
<li>Tool needed to prevent the avalanche</li>
<li>Getting rid of the fee cannot be done by flipping a switch, without new tools it would be a disaster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definitely wants to fix people not getting feedback about ideas</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>They want to do better in this area</li>
</ul>

<li>Perhaps more about seeing how designers work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prototypes<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
