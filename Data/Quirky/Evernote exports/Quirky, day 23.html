While coding, I noticed that product links added by community in submitted ideas is not open by default. Should check a couple of ideas to get an idea of content.
<div><br/></div>
<div>I should probably send an idea or two to Quirky</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Saw an advertisement for Quirky app for iPhone and downloaded it. Checking it out now.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Four options on home page</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Help choose a product</li>
<li>Pricing game</li>
<li>View latest activity</li>
<li>Influence development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help choose a product</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>No filtering options, just scroll down, click to see details and swipe to vote or comment</li>
<li>There's also a more detailed mode of browsing, with pictures, and flipping card for description</li>
<li>Voted for Google glass power case, just because of predicting a market for that</li>
<li>Most of these ideas are crap</li>
<li>This is better way to view ideas than normal website. Also, it's impossible (or at least very difficult) to clip content from app, which means I'll get less data and stuff to code!</li>
<li>Voted for young inventors kit</li>
<li>Voted for conference room whiteboard</li>
<li>Most of the ideas are really bad. After something like 15 min of browsing I've only voted for three, which were not very stunning either. The comment on Feedback Friday on focusing on the problem was really welcome! A-but-a-why??? is the reaction to many of these ideas. They just don't have real use!</li>
<li>I think I reached the ideas from yesterday. I guess this list is in newness order. Could perhaps try to estimate how many ideas they get per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pricing game works like this</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Description of product</li>
<li>At what price would you consider this too expensive / not worth the money?</li>
<li>At what price would you consider this too cheap / of poor quality?</li>
<li>At what price would you consider this a good value / bargain?<br/></li>
<li>At what price would you consider this a bit pricey but still worth buying?<br/></li>
<li>Feedback: Current projected price for Kitchengami is $14.00. Then comparison of aggregate prices with bar chart and my choices</li>
<li>This is kinda fun. Perhaps my second favorite task after naming game</li>
<li>Again, at the feedback, I get a feeling of getting the price right / wrong depending on how close I was to aggregate prices. I'm even trying to adjust my estimates.</li>
<li>I'm also thinking in Euros. For example the too expensive level for a product was $22 (17 €), my price was 15$,</li>
<li>Heh, now after trying to correct, I got the prices within $1 of the "correct" value</li>
<li>This is sort of tempting. After pricing the only way to get forward is to press Next Product. Smart move, Quirky…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Latest activity seems to list activities of Quirky, such as selections made in tasks and opening and closing projects. Boring.</li>
<li>Development offers various development related tasks in categories (?). Categorization is a bit wierd and seems it's not working well yet</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Options at the moment are Research, Community design, Tagline, Naming, </li>
<li>Checking the first research taks</li>
<li>Understood the categorisation! It's divided according to products! Each product may have one or more projects open. </li>
<li>It's not possible to check the details. Serious limitation to answering research questions, when 140 character descriptions are often somewhat vague</li>
<li>Naming game works the same as on the website. Nice and brisk feel to it. Responsive and fast. This is good.</li>
<li>This is fun and fast. I can go on very quickly.</li>
<li>This really is fast. I went from 20 answers to 100 in couple of minutes. It's a shame to stop. And there's new evaluation tempting me. Would be so easy to press the evaluation button…</li>
<li>Imma show this to someone at work!</li>
<li>There's colour codes signifying the names status after they are turned around. Don't know what the coding is. Green is better and red is bad?</li>
<li>Did 20 more. Now I really stop.</li>
<li>There's wrong photo in a product, and I can't see the details. Difficult to answer questions. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community design. This seems confusing. Don't like it. Looks like find a pair game. Not gonna play now. Seems to lack easy way to explore.</li>
</ul>
