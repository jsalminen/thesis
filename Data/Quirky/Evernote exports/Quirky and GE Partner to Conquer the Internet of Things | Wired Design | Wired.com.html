Problem is, they do those cool things all by themselves with no consideration for the other gadgets that are doing equally interesting things around them. This is perfectly fine, but imagine, if you will, a home where your refrigerator communicates with your egg tray and your egg tray communicates with your phone, all in order to make your life easier. This is one grand vision for the Internet of Things, tech’s favorite new fixation, and it’s a reality that’s actually not too far off. All we need is more connected gadgets and a platform to connect them to.</p><p>Enter Wink. The new platform from crowdsourced invention startup Quirky is looking to become the go-to app for your ever-increasing collection of connected items. Launched earlier this year with tech behemoth General Electric, Wink is essentially a way to control all of the internet-connected devices you own.</p><p>Think of it as the command center for your new Internet of Things lifestyle. “If we can give consumers a single app that makes sure all of their connected things work with all of their other connected things, we think that’s really powerful,” says Ben Kaufman, Quirky’s founder and CEO. “With GE’s scale and Quirky’s speed, we have the ability to connect a lot of things super quickly.”</p><p>Tech companies are putting a lot of stock into the whole Internet of Things; Intel just formed a group to accelerate the company’s reach into the marketplace, but no company is taking as big a gamble as GE. This past April, Quirky announced it would be partnering with technology behemoth General Electric to create a small line of co-branded products that would focus on the ever-growing connected-home market. The partnership, at that time, was more or less a trial run. “It was first chapter just to see if we were onto something,” explains Beth Comstock, GE’s Chief Marketing Officer.</p><p>Turns out, they were onto something. Just last week the two companies cemented their collaboration in the form of a lot of money. <a href="http://www.quirky.com/invent" target="_blank">Quirky </a> received $30 million in funding from GE, and together they plan to release more than 30 connected-home products over the next five years that will work alongside Wink. “This category really lacks leadership in my perspective,” says Kaufman, “and letting the world drive it will result in the creation of great products that everyone can understand and use.”</p><div><a href="http://www.wired.com/design/?attachment_id=326551" target="_blank"><div><div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Quirky%20and%20GE%20Partner%20to%20Conquer%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20%7C%20Wired%20Design%20%7C%20Wired.com.resources/resource.png" height="1" width="1"/></div></div> </a><p>The Pivot Power Genius is a flexible power cord whose outlets can be controlled from a mobile device ($79.99). <em>Image: Quirky</em></p></div><p>So far, the collaboration has produced&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quirky.com/shop/quirky-ge" target="_blank">four lighthearted gadgets </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;geared towards the holiday gifting crowd. There’s the Egg Minder, a plastic tray that tracks the freshness of your eggs and alerts you when you’re about to run out; the Pivot Power Genius, a power cord that contorts to accommodate bulky adapters; the Nimbus, a desktop dashboard that keeps track of emails, tweets and such, and the Spotter, a versatile sensor that listens for noises, movement, humidity and temperature. But Quirky and GE’s plans are more ambitious than that.</p><p>GE has granted Quirky access to thousands of patents from its library with the hope that the nimble start up will be able to churn out new, innovative products faster than the lumbering corporation could even dream of doing. This, says Comstock, is one of the main reasons GE wanted to partner with Quirky in the first place. “We were intrigued by the community dynamic and the speed by which the team was able to get great products to market,” she says.</p><p>Quirky is known for its rapid-fire prototype-to-retail process, which draws on the creativity of its 600,000 community members. If you’re not familiar with Quirky, this is how it works: Anyone who signs up can submit a idea, or kernel of an idea, for consideration.</p><p>From there the community votes on its favorites, Quirky’s evaluation team chooses the most promising, and the top inventions go on to be developed by the company’s team of designers and engineers. Those top products get shuffled through the Quirky design, refinement and branding process, and in mere months, a brand new, polished product is ready for retail.</p><p>This is good news for GE, who has more technology than it knows what to do with. But it’s not a one-sided deal. In return, Quirky benefits from GE’s corporate status: things like a quality-assurance program, regulatory knowledge, branding and all those patents.</p><p>Quirky has essentially been given a key to the electronics company’s knowledge base, which include supremely nerdy things like patents for optical systems and dual cooling jets. Which, ok, the applications of which are not immediately obvious, but Kaufman says Quirky is working hard to make GE’s technology approachable and understandable.</p><p>This is the key, he says, to elevating Quirky’s products to a more technologically sophisticated realm. “It’s not hard to imagine that GE has lots of great technologies and throwing a community of 600,000-plus people, saying, ‘Hey what should we do with this,’ will result in some great new products.’”</p>            </div></div></div></div><br/></body></html>
