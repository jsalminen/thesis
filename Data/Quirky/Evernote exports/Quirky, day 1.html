First, probably quick visit to Quirky. I've seen the page and process description before, so I'm somewhat familiar with what and how they do. Collaborative product development, where users post and evaluate ideas and the Quirky team builds prototypes and manufactures the products.
<div>
<ul>
<li>I'm lazy. Signed up using Facebook. It's annoying how much Facebook applications can use my information, and how I have no clue on what they're used for.</li>
<li>I end up to Product evaluation (Beta). There's a bunch of ideas to evaluate and link to instructions video.</li>
<li>Watched the video. The whole process is nicely explained in just less than 2 minutes. I can submit an idea, it gets 30 days, and might go under consideration. Every friday two ideas under consideration are put on the panel and might end up produced. If produced, the user will get royalties forever. If not, the idea can be put into archive, submitted again or taken elsewhere.</li>
<li>This site seems instantly ingenious. The tasks are well defined and easy. At least that's the first impression. I already participated meaningfully, and it was easy and fun. </li>
<li>Playing the pricing game. This is smart. They even have cognitive punishments for people who don't give a price.</li>
<li>Been pricing a couple of products. It's a bit difficult to know what might be appropriate price, but hey, consumers don't have that good sense of prices anyway. There was a nice video of balance board, too.</li>
<li>Watched an instruction video on influence. I doubt the numbers a bit, like who's ever going to score 13 % influence, but I'm still enthusiastic about this site. Spending time here might be more useful than time spend on OpenIDEO, although producing stuff is not that environmentally high goal.</li>
<li>Quirky aligns the selfish motivations of users very neatly with its own business goals. Just genius, is the first impression!</li>
<li>This might be a great site to participate to learn about product design. They've got it all covered, and I think the user can participate in all the phases.</li>
<li>Just found out from the FAQ that posting ideas costs $10. </li>
<li>The learning part of the site feels simple and clearly organized. I feel like I understand the whole process and approach already. </li>
<li>Scrolling trough products in evaluation. Most of these seem like crap to me. Unnecessary gimmicks, but that's propably expected.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There are several filters, but no filter for most popular. Smart. No bias to evaluations.</li>
<li>Number of votes is not available, either. Good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voted on Idea of scraping both sides of grill rods at the same time. That's actually a handy add-on to grill tool.</li>
<li>Many ideas have #spotsv tag in front of them. Why?</li>
<li>Checking out research phase. There's one product now. This seems to be a survey. Smart.</li>
<li>Checked the design phase. They're asking to submit prototypes or sketches or design. This is very smart!</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I can sort them by view-vote ratio. Hmm?</li>
<li>Got an idea for a design, that doesn't seem to be there yet. Trying to make a s     ketch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking the naming phase. There's 550 suggestions for the name for a drinking cap for a dog!!</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Voting for good ones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voting also for the color scheme. </li>
<li>Voting on names and taglines for hiding shelf. This site has many simple and easy task, and I somehow expect them all paying off with real money, at least a bit.</li>
