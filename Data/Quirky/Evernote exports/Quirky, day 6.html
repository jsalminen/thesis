A quick late-night visit to the site
<div>
<ul>
<li>Again new task: research on bike fender</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Bike fender is a good example of user innovation: the user knows the problem intimately, as in this case.</li>
<li>Apparently I can edit or at least suggest edits to ideas submitted by someone else, wiki-style</li>
<li>Weird, this product is already produced by some company I guess. At least there's prototypes. Why do they post it to Quirky? After looking at the quickguard site, it seems like it's only a prototype at this point. Maybe the guy got bored with trying to turn it into a business, and figured it's easier trough Quirky?</li>
<li>Answering the survey about Quick guard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power strip with portable power is also new in community design phase.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Looking trough the suggestions for initial design, on which the Quirky designers then can build the actual prototypes</li>
<li>Voted the original design. It's original. Original is good. Didn't look at the details.</li>
<li>Voted Include outlets for international travel. Sounds good, but I don't even know if it makes sense in this concext. Too tired to care.</li>
<li>Voted for Pivot power travel edition. Found it trough a link at power strip design suggestions (combine these)</li>
<li>Voted Merge this idea with my idea. I like how this suggest innovations as recombinations</li>
<li>Power strip is clearly an incremental innovation. It's building on an already exisiting product by the same company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Infinite scroll is a nice feature on the idea evaluation list. There's plenty of ideas to go trough… Scrolling down a bit.<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Voted a boat that is also a tent. Found also a feature that allows other users to post links to similar products</li>
<li>Voted Padbook. Don't know if it makes that much sense, but an interesting idea.</li>
</ul>
