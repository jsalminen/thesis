To the site.
<div>
<ul>
<li>I have again 15 votes. I guess I get 15 votes per day.</li>
<li>I got an email from Quirky telling me that an idea I voted before was resubmitted. It's the keyholder/organizer. I guess someone made changes. Voted for it. Clipped too, so I can compare it to the original.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Made a comment too.</li>
<li>Now I understand what happened. I voted it yesterday as an idea near deadline. It reached the deadline, so the user resubmitted it, probably in an updated form, as he mentions feedback.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Watching the evaluation video for app enabled egg tray. I like the decision making approach</li>
<li>This was a two-part evaluation. In the first one they decided to come back to it later.<br/></li>
<li>In the second evaluation they decided to build it. There was even a kid there, rising his hand.</li>
<li>After selecting an idea they apparently go through the ideas in the platform in case some people have submitted similar ideas before, so that they can get credit, or influence.</li>
<li>Answered the survey on egg tray.</li>
</ul>
Development<br/>
<ul>
<li>Voted for final design on PowerCurl. Pop colors are the best.</li>
<li> Helping to choose a tagline for bluetooth bracelet</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>77 pages of suggestions, 10 suggestions per page, makes 770 ideas total</li>
<li>Browsing in random order. I have 3 votes and 5 minutes before I have to go to train.</li>
<li>The platform is smart. The ideas I've voted appear on top, and I can drop the votes if I find something better. A bit like a search algorithm, which stores the best result so far!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Helping to choose a name for Prop power rugged</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>This naming thing has changed from the last time I used the site (meaning withing about six months)</li>
<li>The instructions remind me of Wikisurveys. We'll see…</li>
<li>Yes, it's a copy of wikisurveys! LOL!</li>
<li>After clicking the option the system shows their current rank. This is cool.</li>
<li>Naming task was fun. I like Quirky. Would like to do another naming thing, but train interenet is acting up.'</li>
<li>Tried to submit Power Liana, but the name was already suggested.</li>
<li>Seems like I cannot see the current ranking of the names. Only the rankings of names I evaluate are shown shortly. Interesting. It's feedback, but doesn't give away the results.</li>
