To the site. I would like to evaluate refined concepts for Multi-purpose grapnel now. Didn't do it on the last visit.
<div><ul><li>Voted for my favorite version, the cane grapnel. Lots of discussion here on all the concepts, considering the short time they've been online.</li><li>Checking the participate site for more things to do.</li><li>Scrolling down ideas. Opened and voted Tazer bracelet</li><li>Voted for painter buddy</li><li>There's new concepts in community design phase again. This site turns around fast.</li><li>Checked upcoming page. They are making way many products!</li><li>Quirky live is indeed a weekly brainstorm. Would be nice to participate next wednesday. It's late, but my sleeping&nbsp;&nbsp;rhythm&nbsp;&nbsp;is weird.</li><li>Quirky Blog seems lively. At least 12 posts during the past week! Should read it, but going trough everything will be impossible.</li></ul></div></body></html>
