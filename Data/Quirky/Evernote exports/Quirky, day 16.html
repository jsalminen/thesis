Late visit to the site.
<div><ul><li>Got two emails from Quirky asking me to submit name and tagline for Mac Mini Flip Stand</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Checking out the naming task. It's a wikisurvey again.</li><li>There's 683 names. The feedback displays the number of votes each idea has got. I wonder how rankings are calculated. Just the number of votes?</li><li>Seems like it's not just a number of votes. Some names ranked low with many (around 20) votes while others were near the top with just a handful of votes (something like 7)</li><li>Continuing voting after I already got to be an influencer.</li><li>I wanted to collect the numbers of votes, but now the site is not showing them anymore in feedback :(</li><li>Funny, if I clip the voting page to evernote and then copypaste to word, it shows me the rankings even if they are not shown on the webpage or evernote clipâ€¦</li><li>Finished the second set of voting. No number of votes showing even after that.</li></ul></li><li>On to the tagline task. It's the other type of the naming task. I'm still confused whether these two types of tasks are consecutive or alternative phases.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>The tagline instructions state that words mac or i should not be used for legal reasons. Many still do use them</li><li>There's 40 pages of taglines, so I'm browsing them in random order and giving the votes to best three I've seen so far. Like a search algorithm.</li><li>Gave my votes to three options. Went through 20 pages before got bored.</li></ul></li><li>There's two more tasks to do. Checking Mailbox alert sensor.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Completed mailbox alert sensor survey. Took only couple of minutes, and I got influence!</li><li>Voted for the green/grey color for mixing claw. I got influence if my favorite is selected, and this one got the most comments. It was pretty, too, but I was using the number of comments as a proxy. I was sort of between two options, and the comments made the final decision. I still don't know if they are favorable or not.</li></ul></li><li>Last thing to do is vote for ideas for a bit. I have 15 votes again. I guess 15 votes / day is pretty much established fact now.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Voted for time delay lamp. Simple!</li><li>Voted for two headphones in one. I've seen teenagers sharing headphones.</li><li>Voted for office chair half excercise ball</li><li>Did not vote for shared flask for coffee and tea</li><li>Voted for reinvention of vibrator</li><li>Voted for camera to check the fridge</li><li>Getting boring, and I still have 11 votes left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Checking the most active ideas.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Voted for Wink Wall.</li></ul></li></ul></div></body></html>
