</div>
<div>Made a logo with the app during the Brand &amp; story</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cmf on Align</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Voted for two options</li>
</ul>
<div>Cmf LilyLIte</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Voted for color</li>
</ul>
<div>Research on Chinsel</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Replied research questions. There were some from the inventor included. Commented on importance of moving parts resisting hitting with a hammer. Is Quirky actually most of all about finding good problems for the designers and engineers to solve?</li>
</ul>
<div>Pricing game. Did one task.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking the shop. Especially the stats on products.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Cool iPhone wallet cover. Shame it's only for iPhone 5</li>
<li>There's a refer to friend button. I could earn $10</li>
</ul>
<div>Investigating my profile page</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I realized I could follow other people. Haven't felt like it, though. Probably should.</li>
<li>I also haven't submitted any ideas yet. Could try how that goes, too.</li>
</ul>
<div>New comment to my design! Just a comment on previous (joke) comment, but still!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Checking the forum, especially Process, Community and Platform categories</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>How many votes are good. Maybe there's some insights.</li>
<li>Good stuff here in the forum. I should focus now on the forum and blog posts about the process. Perhaps even go through all the blogs and clip the interesting ones? Apart from submitting ideas I think I have the participation to tasks covered.</li>
<li>Every now and then there's Quirky staff commenting on the forum. These are often valuable insights. </li>
<li>I'm really worried about information overload now…</li>
<li>Definitely good insights in comments!! I'm probably going to code only important parts, so that they will show up when retrieving data.</li>
<li>I haven't checked the social sales page yet. Should do it soon.</li>
<li>Browsed through all the forum topics in process category and clipped the interesting looking threads. Really afraid of coding, but I already noticed a couple of gems in there.</li>
<li>Replied to survey on new idea evaluation interface.</li>
<li>Collected interesting discussion on process and platform</li>
<li>Community seems to be more about hanging out with other people on Quirky. Will check it out later.</li>
</ul>
<div>Should fill in the profile. I'm even missing the picture. There's 140 character limit to description. Have to make a good one.</div>
