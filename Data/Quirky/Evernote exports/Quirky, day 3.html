Didn't visit the site yesterday. Too busy with everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br/></div><div>Analysis</div><div><ul><li><b>Disappearance</b> could be considered as one form of feedback: when the user sets the price in pricing game on Quirky, the task disappears, and that's the feedback that tells the user the task has been done. It's mildly satisfying. The next task appears immediately, which is then tempting to perform to make it disappear, too. In comparison, on OpenIDEO all the feedback <b>appears.</b> After applauding there's a small announcement box telling that you have applauded. The tasks don't go away.</li><li>Using artificial intelligence framework and comparing crowdsourcing to search algorithm might indeed be useful. This should be tried a bit later, when I have good description of the site(s).</li></ul><div>To the site
<div><ul><li>Seems like there's new concepts in all the phases of the process. This site has rapid cycle time!</li><li>Checking out community design phase. They're working on a shoelace shortener.</li><li>Already 57 suggestions. It's not many days since I last checked the site. The user base must be much larger than on OpenIDEO</li><li>Again, I find the suggestions with pictures much more interesting and they feel higher quality than the ones without pictures</li><li>Many of the suggestions borrow form from other products</li><li style="list-style: none;"><ul><li>Cigar cutter style</li><li>Nail clipper style</li><li>Glue gun style</li><li>Like cigarette rollers!</li></ul></li><li>Voted for Cigar cutter style</li><li>The site feels damn slow at times!</li><li>Voted and commented Metal aglet tubes</li><li style="list-style: none;"><ul><li>Would do away the need of heating shoe laces</li></ul></li><li>Voted Similar to crimping tool. All my votes for this part of the project are gone. My job is done!</li><li>Commented on the concept too, and gave a link to cigar cutter tool. I feel like achieving many things already! Participating feels easy on this site.</li><li>Checking participate site to see if there's some other easy tasks to do now.</li><li>Quirky has a refinement phase, too. They only have six alternatives for Multi Purpose Grapnel, all made by employees of Quirky. The task is to select the best ones. I only have 1 vote. I'll do it later. There's still over four days left.</li><li>About the platform: number of votes in each project is limited (usually 3), but users can take back the votes, if they change their mind.</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
