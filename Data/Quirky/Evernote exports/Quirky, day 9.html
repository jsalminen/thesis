Missed a couple of days due to other work. Today there's going to be the weekly brainstorming, starting in an hour, and I'm going to participate. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>There's an announcement for new product category: Apple Accessories. Submitting ideas is at least for now free instead of the normal $10</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>It's actually an 24 hour challenge. There's a timer running, only 1 day and two hours before they pick the next Apple Accessory</li>
<li>Learn more -links don't work</li>
<li>Idea description is limited to 140 characters. Same as in Twitter. A coincidence?</li>
<li>Big, friendly button directed me to idea evaluation, because I don't have my own ideas yet. It's filtering on Apple Accessories already, so I get to evaluate only Apple accessories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluating Apple Accessories.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I've noticed I like the infinite scroll. I always turn it on when looking at ideas.</li>
<li>Nothing really interests me on the list. Average and boring. </li>
<li>Changed filtering to most active. Idea on the top of the list got my vote: a iPhone stand for bikes</li>
<li>Voted for sticky cushions for iPhone. They look funny. More creative idea than the usual ones.</li>
<li>Most of the ideas seem to have no comments. I would assume most active filter shows the ones with most discussion, but really fast the number of comments is 0. </li>
<li>My assumption was wrong. Many ideas far down on the list do have at least 1 comment, althought the ideas above have 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taking a break while waiting for the brainstorm to start</li>
</ul>
<div>Quirky Live</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Starting in a few seconds</li>
<li>The chat is going on. There's about 40 users in the chat</li>
<li>About 50 people viewing</li>
<li>This is different from what I saw last week. Now it's only a handful of people around a table. Couple of laptops. Brainstormy environment with large sheets of paper. Two people with laptops.</li>
<li>Talking about some idea. I didn't focus on what exactly it is.</li>
<li>Talking and one of the people is drawing a big mindmap on the table</li>
<li>There's actually lots of old mindmaps on the background</li>
<li>The guy seems to be the leader. Drawing, writing and directing discussion with questions</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>"Has community come up with any examples"</li>
<li>"Other uses for this, how to make this fun, fitting to professional tap dancers…?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's lots of ideas and suggestions going on in the chat</li>
<li>The guy is summarizing the features and asking questions</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>"There's clearly going to be electronics…what material this thing could be, what material it should be?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They have several cameras, including the view from the top showing the whole paper they're working on</li>
<li>Checking out the idea they're talking about, I've got Happy Feet tap shoe attachments</li>
<li>The guy talking about the price people would pay for this, whatever it is</li>
<li>"Any last thoughts before we wrap thisone up?"</li>
<li>The process is fast. It has taken only about 20 minutes, and they have a draft of a concept with a price estimate</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Next idea. They even have a prototype</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the idea. It's 1:23 now</li>
<li>Someone from Quirky (I know because there's a logo in front of the name) posted a link to idea under discussion. It's a helping hand to get injured people independently out of bed</li>
<li>The inventor Rhonda Killian is participating to the chat and complaining about the directions where it is going</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Courtney from Quirky is explainig her why exploring other options is important</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The guy: "do you think there's any categories we're missing?"</li>
<li>LOL! Rhonda getting desperate. "You just put your hand on it and pull yourself up. It's simple!"</li>
<li>My connection is acting up. The stream keeps going offline</li>
<li>About 80 people watching at the moment and 69 people in the chat</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Chat is lively. It's hard to follow the discussion while writing the diary simultaneously</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There seems to be different roles</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Guy is documenting by making a mind map and directing the discussion by making questions</li>
<li>Two ladies are using laptops. I guess they are at least reading and partiicipating to chat</li>
<li>Two other ladies and another guy just join the discussion</li>
<li>6 people participating altogether + the camera operators</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summing up: needs prototypes. Catherine is soothing Rhonda again. "Don't worry, we're just brainstorming possibilities"</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>"is there anything we have missed" or something. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's live eval tomorrow at 7 pm (New York time?)</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>That might be the thing I saw on the blog last week. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's now 1:52. The whole brainstorm took less than an hour, an they worked on two ideas.</li>
