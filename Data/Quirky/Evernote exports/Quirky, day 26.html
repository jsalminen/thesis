<div>Methodology</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Decided to stop collecting data on submitted ideas and product timelines after today. I feel the saturation point has already  been passed on those aspects. They are all the same.</li>
<li>And imitedly got a new flawour of research task. </li>
</ul>
<div>Lots of new research and development tasks on the website.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Participating to research on Vent register cover</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Funny question! Scale goes from Snoozefest to peed my pants</li>
<li>Another one: price range is from lunch money to my first born child</li>
<li>There's also inventor questions. Are these questions the inventor has asked?</li>
<li>This was probably the longest survey I've seen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>App enabled app tray reseach completed. Only two questions</li>
<li>Skin sensing utility knife. Cool concept, the blade senses skin contact and retracts</li>
<li>Reading board game</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Good problem</li>
<li>Wathcing the evaluation video</li>
<li>Did the research. Even added a link to Sugatra Mitra's TED talk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dual action bicycle sprocket research</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Watching evaluation</li>
<li>This decision seemed to be a bit different. Community liked it at 70 % rate. Ben didn't seem to be even listening to opinion from audience, and after a quick vote went for community decision.</li>
<li>Filled in survey. I'm starting to make longer comments in open questions. This one was many rows.</li>
<li>This inventor has already 4 bike related products in the development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dual action bicycle community design</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Only 4 pages of submissions. Going through all of them and voting three</li>
<li>Really crap designs. Found only one good idea.</li>
<li>Found Quirky Forum. This seems to be different from support forum. One more thing to investigate!</li>
<li>What is GetSatisfaction???</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multisensor community design</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I just submitted a design! I draw it with sketchup! That was fun! Voted my own design.</li>
<li>Argh, someone had similar cube idea on the front page… Well, voted for it, too</li>
<li>And another cube design…</li>
<li>And another…</li>
<li>Voted for cubes. If they select cube design, maybe I get influence, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enough for today.</li>
