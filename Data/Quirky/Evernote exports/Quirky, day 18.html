Checking available tasks on the site. Seems like there's new things to do every day. In addition to ever-present idea submission and evaluation. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>It's difficult to know what tasks I've already completed. I'm only relying on my memory.</li>
<li>Timeframes for tasks vary. I think ideas have 30 days for evaluations, but other tasks are typically something between two and six (or seven) days. Some might be shorter still. Rock Pot research only has 8 hours left, and I don't remember seeing it before. </li>
<li>Actually, it might be that I'm just viewing the advertisement panel for tasks, and there's a complete list somewhere</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I think I found a complete list, but it seems to be the same as in the side panel</li>
<li>There's the 10 pages long (240 ideas) list of products in development, but most of them do not have open tasks. Hey, this is actually important. Vast majority of work takes place behind the scenes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research on Refrigerator camera</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Answered a survey</li>
<li>Watching evaluation video, slow connection…</li>
<li>Standard evaluation: description, opinions, vote by hand and applause</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There'll be weekly brainstorm in 7 hours. Today's wednesday. I think I'm going to watch it.</li>
<li>Research on Musical train track</li>
<li style="list-style: none">

<li>Smart idea and combination of toys</li>
<li>Answered the survey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watching the brainstorm video for musical train track<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li><br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rock pot research<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Answered survey. Just two multiple choice questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design: musical train track</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Voting for design options. This is the pick three from 11 pages of options. I have three votes and 2 days time.</li>
<li>Went through all the options and voted for three</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking the shop</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>I count 78 products on the front page, under the heading All Quirky products. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checked the Quirky process. It's a damn fine illustration!!</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Each phase is color coded according who participates: community, user, Quirky or all of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checked upcoming products. There's lots of them! 251 to be precise.</li>
<li>Evaluating a couple of ideas. I'm just scrolling down and throwing votes. Tryihg to get rid of all 15 quickly.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Voted for healthy pregnancy</li>
<li>Voted for very functional backpack. </li>
<li>It's difficult to find ideas to vote for. Most submissions are crap. No wonder Quirky wants to charge for submissions.</li>
<li>It's like most of the ideas lack real use. What problem are they trying to solve. For example: All in one notebook, Pool light that light up when you jump in, Levi's button fastener,Motorized shopping cart with GPS tracker, Flash drive hair brush, Digital lunch box… Some of these are really WTF in my opinion...</li>
<li>Voted for VacPack</li>
<li>Voted for birdhouse with camera</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enough. Managed to spent 5 votes before getting bored.</li>
</ul>
