Happended to demonstrate Foursquare a couple of times today. Unexpectedly got a like on Facebook from Turisti. Unexpectedly strong dopamine effect (?).
<div><br/></div>
<div>Waiting for Quirky live to start. Apple accessories.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It started. High level of enthusiasm CEO (?) explaining how it works. They're going to go trough 53 pre-selected ideas. 90 seconds for each ideas.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Divided to cases and non-cases</li>
<li>Cases first 30-something ideas.</li>
<li>Really fast-fire: "I think this is a no-brainer…" "you like it. next."</li>
<li>around 250 people participating online</li>
<li>There's the expert panel, audience, chat and voting thingies for people online</li>
<li>Found the like/unlike meter. </li>
<li>"Do we have an objection? Speak!"</li>
<li>"Anyone else have an opinion? Negative opinion?"</li>
<li>Current idea is nicely shown on the top of the page. This is cool.</li>
<li>Process is somewhat like this</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ol>
<li>Short presentation of idea</li>
<li>Expert opinions</li>
<li>Some opinions from audience</li>
<li>Negative opinions, if any</li>
<li>Community opinion</li>
<li>Vote with cheering</li>
<li>Decision: pass, accept, bubble, explore</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Definitely no time to follow what's going on in the chat</li>
<li>Somewhere fab.com was mentioned. Is this challenge (or whatever they call it) a collaboration?</li>
<li>Not many liking an idea. "Who likes it? We're going on to vote. Next."</li>
<li>350 people watching and about 300 on chat</li>
<li>Time goes up for the idea, there's the bell. "Oh, vote now!" Strict policy on time.</li>
<li>Site crashed a bit. Chatlog is gone :(</li>
<li>Fab seems to be a design shop. A collaboration with Quirky would make sense.</li>
<li>Chat seems mostly useless for decision making process</li>
<li>Ben is asking first a round of comments from the panel, then couple of comments from the audience. Possibly check what the chat thinks, and then moves on to vote. The vote decides whether Quirky will make the product or not.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Ben asks often for opposing opinions, someone liking or not liking the idea, depending on what others think</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I wonder how they select the shortlist for evaluation</li>
</ul>
<div>Gotta catch my plane. Have to stop watching, even though they are still evaluating ideas.</div>
</div>
