Methodology
<div>
<ul>
<li>Decided to stop coding feedback and idea evaluation comments on ideas. They are all just the same, and it takes very much time. I'll just check the comments in case there's something else than standard "Like the idea! Voted! Good luck!"</li>
<li>Same with interaction on comments. Yes, they are all interaction. I can remember that without a code.</li>
<li>Coding the chatlog: decided to code only parts that feel significant, meaning for example questions by facilitator and useful comments (something else than small talk)</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Ended up skipping the coding at least for now. Too much work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Got an weekly digest email from Quirky. It advertises new naming and tagline game. Apparently wikisurveys are a new thing for the site. Also they call it a game. Like the older pricing game. More games coming?</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There's interesting looking blog post about this. With hugely many comments. </li>
<li>Skimmed through the comments. Variable response to the change from the community. Many seem not to get the idea of this type of evaluation. </li>
<li>Checking the wikisurvey paper by Salganik. Out of interest.</li>
<li>Posted two comments to blog post about new system.</li>
<li>Considering posting about gamelike punishments implemented in the skip button, but not sure how to formulate and to whom to post: to blog or directly to designer.</li>
</ul>
<div>Research on Holiday lights</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Answered a survey. Mostly N/A or no answers. I don't know if I even got influence.</li>
</ul>
<div>Community refine project on Collapsible bike helmet</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Voted for latch option. Only two options to select from.</li>
</ul>
<div>Idea evaluation</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Browsing newest ideas. Trying to find something to spent my votes on. This task feels somehow tedious. So many poor ideas and good ones are far apart.</li>
<li>Voted for airtight lemon squeezer</li>
<li>Ooh! Found out I can expand the ideas from the list without opening in the new page! So handy!!</li>
<li>Voted for posthole digger turned to trench digger. There might be a problem</li>
<li>Voted for soap hook. Simple and easy.</li>
<li>Voted for plant pot with two partitions. Its something that's already done.</li>
<li>Voted for makeup removing pen</li>
<li>Voted for reward cord.</li>
<li>After discovering the expand function the evaluation feels much more bearable. Going to new tab really broke the flow before.</li>
<li>Some of the ideas are just weird: iPhone holder for toilet</li>
<li>Commented on UV light to kill bacteria in shower.</li>
