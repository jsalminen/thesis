To the site.
<div><ul><li>Browsing new ideas. I have 15 votes to use.</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Most of the ideas are useless in my opinion. There' no real need for male pads to prevent urine stains after using restroom...</li><li>First World problems meme comes to mind...</li><li>Quirky has updated the platform. Now it is possible to refine submissions from other users. Big revisions may be worth influence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Methodology: An issue here is that I have collected data from the site when it looked different. Therefore a new rule. There will be at least 30 days of data collection in a row. So, I'll have to collect data on Quirky for the next 30 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Read Suction cup handles for toothbrush etc. Not interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Voted 5-gallon bottle (40 lbs) lift-n-invert. Water dispenser bottles actually are somewhat difficult to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Considered voting a balloon to get a reception in remote area. Interesting idea, but I doubt the solution would work and the problem is not that good either.</li><li>Read snowball gun. Very much yankee marketing in this one. Definitely no vote.</li><li>Voted for reverse pot. There might be a good enough problem that no-one has addressed yet.</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Well, it turned out in the discussion that there's a good reason for pots to be like they are. Plants need to be changed to another pot from time to time...</li></ul></li><li>Read Catnip t-shirt. This one sounds like made by a crazy cat lady.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Voted for a portable printer for iPad. One of the more sensible ideas.</li><li>I have way many votes, still 12 left. I wonder how long do they last?</li></ul><div><br/></div></div><div>Checked the idea submission forms</div><div><ul><li>Three categories: Everyday products, app-enabled products and Apple accessories</li><li>Quirky is collaborating with GE to create app-enabled products. The brand is Wink, I guess. Wink for instant connection</li><li>Everyday product ideas cost $10 to submit. Quirky + GE (Wink) ideas it is not clear what the cost is. Apple accessories ideas are free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>They explicitly mention Quirky does not have anything to do with Apple.</li><li>All the forms are a bit different, but the basic principles behind them seem to be similar. Should confirm this later in analysis!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>For example, all of the limit summary to 140 characters and ask the user to describe both the problem and the solution.</li></ul></li></ul><div>Checked products in development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><div><ul><li>Just wow. There's 10 pages of them, 24 products per page. That would mean around 240 product in development at the moment.</li></ul><div>Participating in development</div></div><div><ul><li>Decided to take a survey on Rice-for-one</li><li>They first ask demographics. A bit too detailed, when they first want to know my birthday... Year is right but I'm lying the exact date. Just because.</li><li>Answered a survey, but I'm not sure if it went through.</li><li>There's cool product development timeline</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>They show the evaluation meeting where they decided to build rice-for-one</li><li>Decision making took 5 minutes. Discussion and voting, all done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>There would be live product evaluation in 9 hours. That would be in the middle of the night. Maybe I should.</li><li>Watched the video on brainstorm</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>It's collaborative design. They discuss about the features and needs for the rice-for-one</li><li>They even did three surveys on community during the 15 min disucssion</li><li>End result is a mind map of the product</li></ul></li></ul><div><img src="Quirky,%20day%2012.resources/BEA567DE-0128-4D9F-8193-873E229D7E5B.png" height="300" width="525"/></div></div><div><br/></div><div><ul><li>Quirky process for RiceForOne seems to be</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Idea submission</li><li>Product evaluation</li><li>Development, with sub-stages</li><li>Something?</li></ul></li></ul><div>Development</div></div><div><ul><li>Voted for my 5 favorite tool attachements.
