OXO and our design partner, Smart Design, of appropriating a feature from a
product called the Broom Groomer, which was submitted to their community in
2009 by an independent inventor and launched in 2010. Their product includes
"rubber 'teeth' on the back of the dustpan [that] … quickly and easily comb out
dust bunnies."<br clear="none" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"/><br clear="none" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"/>
While we're a good-natured group, we have serious respect for designers and
inventors alike, and we want to make sure the design community – including
everyone involved with Quirky – has all of the information needed to understand
what's going on.
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;"/>
    <h6 style="margin:0px;padding:0px;color:red;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-size:18px;line-height:18px;font-family:arial;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:5px;">Let's start at the very beginning</h6>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
    For a little background, all of this started on Monday with a billboard on 28th
Street in Chelsea, just two blocks from OXO's office. Quirky claimed the OXO
Upright Dust Pan "ripped off" their design. An image of the billboard was shared
with Quirky's nearly 30,000 Facebook fans.
</p>

<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
On Tuesday, this escalated to a picket line outside of our office building during the
busy morning hours, led by Quirky CEO Ben Kaufman. You can find photos and a
video of the event on Quirky's blog and Facebook page. Images were also shared
on Twitter and Instagram. If you want more details of what transpired, visit:<br clear="none" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"/>

<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
In the video, Mr. Kaufman says, "At Quirky, we believe in one thing and one thing
that's very special, which is human protection. We believe that humans are
innately good people and that if a problem arises that they will do the right thing.
It's our job today to show a very big company what that right thing is."
</p>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
We were surprised that Quirky didn’t first address their issue with us before
taking it public. Our companies are two blocks apart. We have about the same
number of employees. We know the people that work there and they know us.
Our leaders have spoken. Isn't it a little strange that they didn't think to pick up
the phone and call first? Wouldn’t that have been the right thing to do?
</p>

<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
Unfortunately, the designer of Quirky’s Broom Groomer wasn’t the first person
to come up with the idea of teeth on a dustpan. The idea was actually invented
almost 100 years ago. On September 9, 1919, the patent for this idea was
issued to Addison F. Kelley from Freeland Park, IN. Information about this patent
(No. US1,315,310) is available here: <a shape="rect" target="_blank" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-decoration:none;border:none;">http://www.google.com/patents/US1315310</a>.

brush used in connection with the pan...
It will be apparent… that a broom or
brush may be readily cleaned and
particles of hair and the like removed
therefrom by inserting the teeth into the
body of the brush and then pulling
thereon until the teeth are free of the
outer ends of the bristles of the brush or
broom, at which time the dirt removed
will fall into the dust pan."</i><br clear="none" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"/>
</p><div style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-size:10px;color:gray;">US Patent &amp; Trademark Office<br clear="none" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"/>
http://www.google.com/patents/US1315310
</div>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;"/>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
Why is this description important? Ever since Mr. Kelley's patent expired in 1936,
any dustpan that includes teeth to effectively clean debris from broom or brush
bristles will likely resemble each other, because each relies on the same, formerly
patented, feature.

     <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">In 2012, OXO President Alex Lee met with
Quirky CEO Ben Kaufman at their office to
discuss product design and innovation. At
one point, Alex asked what steps Quirky took
to protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of this
broad community when inventors submit
their idea in an open and public forum.
Mr. Kaufman responded, "Nothing. Speed
to market is our best protection."</p>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">At OXO we believe wholeheartedly in our
design partners and inventors. Every year,
we pay millions of dollars in royalties to both
to protect their integrity and reward them for
their talents. Needless to say, we take IP
very, very seriously.</p>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
    Understanding Quirky's take on IP, we think
the inventor community should understand a
few things before they submit ideas online.
The most important one is this: Once you
disclose an unprotected idea publicly, without
a confidentiality agreement, you have lost the
right to file a patent in some countries
(including Taiwan) and the clock starts ticking
for the rest of the world. From that point, you
have 12 months within which to file a patent
application. It's not enough to sign a
non-disclosure agreement with Quirky. You
must be protected from ALL parties privy to
your idea – that includes the entire Quirky
community of 336,000 inventors.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
    Even if Quirky eventually takes steps to apply
for a patent to protect your idea, they also
have to do so within the 12-month window.
But if Quirky decides not to pursue the ideas
you submitted publicly, it is then your own
responsibility to file against that ticking
clock. Please understand your risks before
publicly submitting your ideas.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
    Sadly for the inventor of the Broom Groomer
the facts are a little blurry. This week,
Quirky's billboard said the Broom Groomer
was invented in 2009. However, Quirky.com
states the idea was publicly displayed
beginning March 2, 2010. The application
with the US Patent Office was not filed until
April 18, 2011 – in either case, it was past the
12 month window.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
    What does this mean? This means whatever
additional features Quirky sought to protect
for the Broom Groomer beyond those in the
original 1919 Kelley patent will likely be ruled
invalid by the US Patent Office for not
adhering to the 12-month window. The
inventor might want to consider following up
with Quirky about this.

     <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
     Business aside, we're huge supporters of
creativity and education in the design
community. And as designers and inventors
ourselves, we believe it's our responsibility to
understand the legal boundaries of our work.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
    To this point, one of OXO's Senior Product
Engineers, Rich, has offered to give a "Patent
Process Primer" for the inventor community,
one based on the experiences, frustrations
and strategies around protecting IP that we
have learned over the years. Naturally, all
Quirky inventors and employees are
welcome too.

In fact, every single one of the features in our product is covered by the 1919 patent. Not one of the features has anything
to do with the assertions made by Quirky. Plus, our version of this bristle-cleaning concept is featured on a Sweep Set and
Long-Handled Dustpan, not a foot-held dustpan like Quirky's. And our teeth are higher off the ground so it's easier to clean
the full bristle head of a Sweeper or a Broom. Not only that, our teeth are made of rigid plastic, not rubber, to provide strength
when combing through the bristles and a surface that will not retain dust and hair.
</p>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
Ideas are limitless and patents expire for a reason: to encourage competition, innovation, and the evolution of new ideas that
ultimately benefit the end user. If patents never expired, we would have only one car company, and the cars they develop
would likely not be readily available and affordable to so many people all over the world. Imagine that.
</p>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
At OXO, we either invent or improve. In this instance, we improved upon Mr. Kelley’s patent. Many other innovators do this
as well. Apple did not invent the Walkman. They did not invent the cell phone. They did not invent the tablet computer. Their
designers improved each and now millions of people enjoy the fruits of their improvements.

<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
We recognize that Quirky is relatively new and there are a few things they are still figuring out. In the spirit of collaboration,
we'd like to share some pointers as Quirky continues to iterate on its business model:
</p>
<table style="font-size:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;margin:0px;padding:0px;"><tr style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;padding-right:10px;padding-bottom:10px;vertical-align:top;width:32%;">Just because an idea was submitted

does not mean it's new. In fact, a similar
product could have already been
launched and discontinued.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;padding-right:10px;padding-bottom:10px;vertical-align:top;width:32%;padding-left:15px;">Just because a patent application was
submitted does not mean the application
has been reviewed or approved. It also
doesn't mean a patent will be issued.</td></tr></table><br clear="none" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"/>
<h6 style="margin:0px;padding:0px;color:red;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-size:18px;line-height:18px;font-family:arial;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:5px;">Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery</h6>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
With over 800 OXO tools, we also come across products that look strikingly similar to our own. At this point, many consumers
don't realize that prior to OXO, there were no soft, comfortable non-slip grips on kitchen tools or other consumer products.
We appreciate the competition's right to incorporate this feature to the point where it is now commonplace. In the end, the
consumer won.
</p>
<p style="margin:0px;padding:0px;margin-bottom:13px;">
While we'd never go so far as to hold a public protest, we thought we'd take this chance to share a few examples of Quirky
products that have a strangely familiar "OXO" touch.

to 16 Million views. The video was published on July 30th, 2012, and was not the first to describe this idea. Three weeks later,
a product with the same idea (Pluck) was introduced to Quirky’s community. Now, we give the inventor the full benefit of the
doubt - there is no way of knowing whether he saw the video prior to his invention. Still, should the consumers who posted the
videos cry foul? When similar products, inspired by these creative videos, are introduced by other manufacturers, will Quirky
come after them, as well?
