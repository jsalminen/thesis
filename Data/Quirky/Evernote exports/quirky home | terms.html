<p style="margin:10px 0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;border:0px;outline:0px;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:no-repeat no-repeat;">
You acknowledge that: (i) by using the Site you will have access to User Content provided by other Users, and (ii) User Content and Site Content may be provided under license by independent content providers, including contributions from other Users. The Company may not pre-screen User Content submitted by Users to the Site. You acknowledge that the Company and other Users have rights in their respective Site Content and User Content under copyright and other applicable laws and treaty provisions, and that except as described in this Agreement, such rights are not licensed or otherwise transferred by mere use of the Services or posting on the Site.

<p style="margin:10px 0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;border:0px;outline:0px;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:no-repeat no-repeat;">
You agree that the Company has the absolute right and permission to use your name, voice, image, likeness, and your applicable User compensation information, including for example any commisions paid and your Influence percentage, as well as representations made by you, in any media (including, without limitation, television, print, radio and the Internet), world-wide, for the purposes of advertising, promoting, reporting and disseminating information about the Company, the Company’s business or an Accepted Product Idea.</p>

<p style="margin:10px 0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;border:0px;outline:0px;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:no-repeat no-repeat;">
The Site has been created primarily to provide low-cost market research to a Person with respect to Product Ideas. An Idea Submitter must pay the advertised fee to submit a Product Idea to the Community. The Site will collect and organize feedback received from the Community with respect to each Product Idea and will provide the results to the Idea Submitter. The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the volume or quality of any feedback provided and each Idea Submitter acknowledges and agrees to bear the risk that Users may not provide any meaningful feedback with respect to a Product Idea.</p>

<h2 style="margin:0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;border:0px;outline:0px;font-size:18px;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:no-repeat no-repeat;font-weight:normal;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;color:rgb(0, 74, 128);">Payments by the Company to Users</h2>
<p style="margin:10px 0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;border:0px;outline:0px;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:no-repeat no-repeat;">
While one aspect of the Site is to provide Users, including Idea Submitter’s with the right to share in Product Sales Revenue, Users should not participate on the Site or in the Services primarily for financial gain, as any actual monetary compensation actually received by a User in connection with the Site, may or may not bear any relation to the actual time invested on the Site, or the quality or quantity of User Content submitted, or Influence allocated. The Company will make 30% of Product Sales Revenue from Thirty Percent Transactions and 10% of Product Sales Revenue from Ten Percent Transactions available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in the underlying Accepted Product Idea generating the Product Sales Revenue. The Company will make a referral payment to Users who refer customers to the Company at a rate of 10% of the Product Sales Revenue generated from Web Store Sales directly attributable to such referrals. In order to be eligible to receive such referral payments, the customer generating the Product Sales Revenue from the Web Store Sale on which such referral payment is to be made must complete the referral section on the purchase order identifying the referring User at the time of the customer’s order. In addition to the foregoing, the Company will make a referral payment to Users who refer Idea Submitters to the Company at a rate of 20% of the idea submission fees generated by the Company in connection with the referred Idea Submitter’s posting of a Product Idea. In order to be eligible to receive such referral payments, the Idea Submitter generating the idea submission fees on which such referral payment is to be made must complete the referral section on the Product Idea submission to the Company at the initial time of the Product Idea submission. In no event will a User be credited for any referral payments unless they are specifically identified at the time of sale or idea submission (as applicable). Because the Company may elect in its sole discretion to cease commercializing any Accepted Product Idea, there can be no guarantee that you will ever receive any payments or actual compensation in connection with participating on the Site or providing User Content even if you participate or provide User Content. Quirky makes no representations or warranties regarding any actual monetary compensation that may be earned in connection with use of the Site or the Services. Quirky’s obligation to pay Product Sales Revenue to Users, who are allocated such amounts pursuant to the Site, is limited to paying such allocations based upon Product Sales Revenue that is actually received by Quirky. Notwithstanding any Product Sales Revenue that may be allocated to your account, Quirky shall be under no obligation to distribute such amount to you until such time as the aggregate amount payable in your account exceeds $75. The Company will calculate all payments owed by the Company to a User as set forth above, on a daily basis, based on the previous day’s sales of a Accepted Product Idea. All amounts earned by a User shall be rounded down to the nearst tenth of cent. If the total amount that a User earns (including from Ten Percent Transactions, Thirty Percent Transactions, Web Store Sales referrals and idea submission referrals)) for the previous day is less than a tenth of penny (e.g. $.001) then such amount shall be rounded down to zero and no amount will be credited to the User. On an annual basis, Quirky reserves the right to reset all User accounts below $75 to $0 and to write-off all such unpaid amounts and Quirky shall have no liability for any such write-offs. Quirky also reserves the right to withhold or forfeit payments due to any User that has breached this Agreement or any of the other guidelines related to use of the Site. The Company will make payments to Users, upon request from Users for payments, by check, ACH, wire transfer (fee assessed to User) or through any other commercially reasonable manner adopted by the Company from time to time. Subject to the foregoing terms, upon the death of a User, Quirky will direct payments associated with the Influence accruing from the deceased User’s participation on the Site prior to such User’s death, to a replacement payee if: (a) the Person requesting a replacement payee presents verifiable documentation supporting the replacement payee’s legal entitlement to the deceased User’s payments, and (b) the request for a replacement payee is received by Quirky within one year from the date of the deceased User’s death. If Quirky does not receive a request for replacement payee that complies with the foregoing conditions, Quirky may cancel the deceased User’s account, and write-off any unpaid amounts, with no liability for any such write-offs.

<p style="margin:10px 0px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;border:0px;outline:0px;font-size:12px;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:no-repeat no-repeat;">
If an Accepted Product Idea is not selected by Quirky for manufacturing within nine months of initially launching on the “Upcoming” page of the Site, the Accepted Product Idea Submitter has the option to, within one week of the aforementioned nine month deadline, acquire ownership from Quirky of all Intellectual Property Rights in the commercialized version of the Accepted Product Idea, in return for paying Quirky 10% of all revenues generated from such Intellectual Property Rights in perpetuity, and losing all accrued Influence concerning the Accepted Product Idea. If the Idea Submitter exercises the aforementioned option, Quirky shall receive a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, fully transferable license from the acquirer of the Intellectual Property Rights to use such Intellectual Property Rights in Quirky’s business, but not to develop products that compete with the acquired commercialized version of the Accepted Product Idea. The foregoing acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights shall be contingent upon the acquirer signing Quirky’s standard intellectual property assignment and license agreement memorializing the foregoing terms.

You acknowledge and agree that you be responsible for all taxes due on any payments made to you in connection with your participation on the Site. The Company will be under no obligation to make any payments to you unless you have properly completed and submitted the Quirky Payee Information Form (the “QPIF”) and the information required in the registration process related to backup withholding taxes. Backup withholding taxes are a type of withholding for federal income taxes on certain types of income. Quirky may be required by law to withhold these taxes from amounts payable to you unless you are otherwise exempt from backup withholding. US citizens and resident aliens will typically be exempt from backup withholding if they properly report their name and Social Security number to Quirky on the QPIF and that information matches the IRS records.</p>
