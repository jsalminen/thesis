Evaluating ideas on the website. There's categories and filters, but I'm just using the default, which is newest.
<div>
<ul>
<li>I have 15 votes again. Perhaps I should try to spend them.</li>
<li>I like to use infinite scroll on evaluation</li>
<li>Voted Wink Wifi Repeater Extender. Considered updating the problem definition, but didn't.</li>
<li>Voted home ironing mannequin.</li>
<li>Voted zoomable iphone lens. I realized that using the votes increases my changes to get some influence, if one of them goes through.</li>
<li>Voted and commented for double sided ironing board. The problem is described very well, so there might be market.</li>
<li>Voted and commented Medical histories all in single microchip. Reminds me of health stick. Perhaps mention that later?</li>
<li>Voted universal paint can lid. Just to be a part and have a change on gaining influence.</li>
</ul>
<div>Looking at the most active ideas. I'm not sure what this filter really does.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Voted for tool cube. It was active, and many people had commented. Perhaps it has changes.</li>
<li>Voted for multi-functional 3 in 1 rolling pin garden tool. Might have changes.</li>
<li>Voted for better tie down ratched. Lots of effort, a video and perhaps even a prototype. I wonder why this person does not produce it by himself? Maybe Quirky is an easier channel.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>The prototype really exists! It looks very neat. </li>
<li>Looks very high quality, but perhaps a bit too fancy and complicated to manufacture?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voted for self-regulating greenhouse. I don't know if it's any good, but the heading said it has 400+ votes. I just want to be part of this in case it goes through. So many people cannot be wrong…</li>
<li>Voted for UC 318 because it said 92 % new votes and there seemed to be a lot of activity. Just spending my votes.</li>
<li>Voted for Piano doorbell. Funny idea!</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the ideas whose evaluation time is ending soon. I have 3 votes left.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Voted and commented Key holder/organizer. </li>
</ul>
<div>Smart piggy bank community design phase</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Looking to vote in community design. I'm filtering the options at random.</li>
<li>Voted for Piggy! Just like online gaming system and mini games on the app when you reach certain amounts</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Got an idea for an app: You have to pay to use your own games, a bit like micropayments, but to yourself. Seems to be working on many mobile games these days.</li>
<li>Actually might not fit with the original idea, which is aimed at kids. Or maybe it would. They would need to save money to play games. LOL!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created and voted for micropayments to yourself to play your games. Midway through I started thinking that maybe this is too good idea to give away for free. Perhaps I could do something about it myself… Although I doubt I would. It's too difficult to implement for my skills.</li>
</ul>
<div>Mac Mini Flip Stand</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Voted for white design. This was project was almost done.</li>
</ul>
<div>Enough now.</div>
