Long break since the last visit. I was in conference and just didn't have the time and energy to participate. Now also only time for a quick visit. Probably will do a couple of easy tasks and call it a day.
<div><ul><li>Checking the Refinement phase for Nut butter grinder. My task is to choose my favorite concept from the suggestions made by the Quirky designers</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Looked at the pictures of different designs and voted for Twist to dispense. Most simple and elegant in my opinion. Didn't look at what the other users had written, but that would have been possible.</li></ul></li><li>Checked out refinement phase of Rolling pin with a handle. Didn't really understand it, but still voted. Saw a couple of comments while clipping the pages to Evernote. Voted for the one that someone had mentioned to be the best option after some consideration: &nbsp;&nbsp;"<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">After taking a good look at this it actually seems easiest to use."</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I also saw someone stating that another option was not a good design.</li><li>Considered to participate to refinement phase of Hot Glue gun, but at this point it feels like too much clipping. However, I noticed the designs had been submitted by the user called Quirky Invention Ambassador. The user profile has a logo stating that this user works for Quirky</li><li>Ended up participating after all. Voted for Easy squeeze, back trigger button. Most simple and somehow closest to the original idea. Or maybe not, but I liked it the most. Others seemed complex.</li><li>Checked the influence I have. I have already made some influence! Apparently the most influence comes from posting ideas, and after that from voting. I got 0.4 % influence for voting and 0.006 for participating to a survey. Nice!</li></ul></div></body></html>
