To the site. I saw a tweet about the summary of Quirky live being in the blog. Going to check it out.
<div>
<ul>
<li>There's a video of the Quirky live. Reminds me of some sort of lion cave or auction on ideas. </li>
<li>"We love when inventors post videos"</li>
<li>They have suggested price point running live on the screen. Cool!</li>
<li>Lots of audience. I'm guessing they're Quirky employees. The chairman of the event asked them "Do you think we as Quirky would like to make this product?"</li>
<li>Very fast paced, but insightful</li>
<li>Fun and energetic event. </li>
<li>This is a cool way to do the transparency.</li>
<li>One guy is following the discussion on the chat, I assume. Pretty much like AJ Stream</li>
<li>They're voting by rising hands. The voting can be manipulated and people can be convinced to change their minds</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>"Ok, not producing, should we explore it more?"</li>
<li>"Try to convince them"</li>
<li>"We should explore this at least for an hour"</li>
<li>"Yeah!" Single clap!" "CLAP!!" </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is truly effective decision making process. It's really fast, and they get a consensus. <br/></li>
<li>There's discussion on Twitter: #QuirkyLive</li>
<li>In a case of tie, they have a thumbs up / down with the community. It took maybe 30 seconds. Audience went "wooooooo!".  The voting was not decisive, so they moved the decision later. Fast and efficient decision making.</li>
<li>People are having beers.</li>
<li>This is genius!</li>
<li>The chairman is a real showman</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>He's soliciting differing viewpoints. "Ok, you don't like it. Who does like it?"</li>
<li>"Community has done a good job at showing us what there is already on the market"</li>
<li>Should &lt;name&gt; become a Quirky inventor tonight?"</li>
<li>"Explore is put on the table, should we explore it?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They seem to have a few clear options for decisions on each idea.</li>
<li>The sceen on the background shows the idea in special view, with most important information in one screen</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Person who posted the idea, date, number of ideas and number of products</li>
<li>Live community measurements: Live poll meter and three buttons, I don't know what they are</li>
<li>Image of the idea</li>
<li>Relevant statistics: exposures, views, votes, comments</li>
<li>Additional Images</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The screen actually scrolls down and there's more<br/></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Considered by</li>
<li>Problem</li>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Links to similar products</li>
<li>Features</li>
<li>Couple of comments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chairman rises his hand first when asking the people to vote. Only small reaction. "We're moving on to next idea"</li>
<li>I wonder how many decisions they make during a meeting. Should keep count next week. I'll try to stay awake and participate next wednesday.</li>
<li>Eight new projects lauched this week, according to the blog. Quirky seems to structure the tasks around projects. Sort of sub-projects during the product development.</li>
<li>Again, asking for opinions of people who like it, after someone explained why he doesn't like the idea</li>
<li>"This is complete yes, not explore. Should &lt;name&gt; become a Quirky inventor tonight? It's a yes!" CLAPPING</li>
<li>Doing this sort of thing requires thorough understanding how the product development process proceeds. It must be pretty much standardized.</li>
<li>Prerequisite for succesfull crowdsourcing: understand the process you're trying to crowdsource?</li>
<li>They're looking at similar products</li>
<li>"Tell me why should we make this? Read us some of the positive comments from the net."</li>
<li>Other person telling reasons why a product should be made</li>
