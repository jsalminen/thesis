<div><ul><li>Participating to Quick release fender Community design phase</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Scrolling through the suggestions</li><li>Voted for original idea, mounting point taking account the torque, and original idea with permanent adapter for non-quick-release hubs</li><li>Done voting. Achievement complete!</li><li>Influence is an interesting measure: "Influence is a real-time measure of your contributions to a project. You can earn influence either by submitting a winning idea, or by supporting and refining that winning idea." So, influence is only earned, if the user happens to work on something that becomes a product. This is an incentive to self-select to contribute to useful things in useful ways, and prevents gaming the system by just spamming unnecessary comments or stupid ideas on purpose.</li></ul></li><li>I've done all the current research and design tasks. Now there's only evaluating ideas or submitting my own left.</li><li>Scrolling trough the newest ideas and voting if I see something good</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Here the task is actually to spot promising ideas, or recognize a cool product when you see one</li><li>Voted for the maple seed shaped fan</li><li>Vast majority of the ideas feels like cheap, useless crap to me. Very specific curiosities for problems that don't really need to be solved. "Bucket full of balls so children can count them", "Binder for cigarette case and lighter" = rubber band</li><li>Voted Flixplug, a usb-sized minicomputer that can only be used to stream netflix</li></ul></li></ul><div><br/></div></div></body></html>
