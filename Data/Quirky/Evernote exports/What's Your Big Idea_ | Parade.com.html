                    ‘It’s waffle morning!” 24-year-old Ben Kaufman exclaims as he bounds into a New York City
kitchen. Two twentysomethings are already at the counter; one plugs in a waffle maker; the other
mixes a bowl of batter. “You have to melt the butter first,” Kaufman says, “or you won’t be able to
stir it in.”

<br clear="none"/> This isn’t a cooking class, or a hipster brunch—it’s serious business. Kaufman founded
Quirky.com 15 months ago with an ambitious idea: to reinvent the business of invention. Each week,
dozens of amateur Edisons nationwide submit ideas for gadgets like the Ultimate Waffle Iron Kaufman
is working on today. (Easy to clean! No more batter dripping down the sides!) Next, hundreds of
online community members (or “Quirks”) weigh in on the products and vote for their favorites.
Kaufman and his team cull the results, sort out potential patent conflicts or production problems,
then make the final call on the week’s winning thingamabob—which, if all goes well, will become
Quirky’s newest product. Kaufman calls the process “social product development.”

<br clear="none"/> “The world needs this right now,” Kaufman says. “There are tons of people at home with no
way to get their product ideas out to the world, and we can put the pieces together.” He hopes that
by bringing the best ideas to market, he can become a new kind of mogul himself. “I want Quirky to
be the Procter &amp; Gamble of the 21st century,” he says. So far, venture capitalists have
invested $7.5 million. 
<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/> Kaufman’s entrepreneurial journey started young. As a precocious 8-year-old in Huntington,
N.Y., he created a Power-Point presentation that won his mom a major account with a cosmetics
company—and earned him a $2000 kickback. Ben’s next venture: charging his parents’ friends for
loading CDs onto their iPods. “He was a very unique child,” says his mother, Mindy Kaufman. “He was
always thinking up his next business.”

<br clear="none"/> At 18, Kaufman thought up his first invention: the Song Sling, an iPod Shuffle case with
retractable headphones. His parents re-mortgaged their home to fund production, and Song Sling won
a coveted “Best of Show” award at the MacWorld convention for fans of Apple computers. The Kaufmans
kept their house, and Ben became a successful CEO. He dubbed his company Mophie. 
<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/> In 2007, Kaufman returned to MacWorld with an even more novel idea: He handed out sketch
pads and asked people to come up with their own inventions. The winning design—an iPod case/bottle
opener—became Mophie’s newest product. The instant feedback and collaboration electrified him. “I
realized that every product should be developed this way,” Kaufman says. He sold his company and
left Champlain College in Vermont to focus full-time on Quirky.com. Less than two years later, he’s
brought more than 50 inventions to market, from a modular pocket knife with removable attachments
to a self-cleaning broom and dustpan.

<br clear="none"/> To weed out the time machines and other impossible gizmos, Quirky charges $10 for each idea
submitted. Still, crazy concepts get floated. (Edible frisbee, anyone?) Quirks debate the pros and
cons of each and cast their votes at the end of the week. When I submitted my idea for FindIt!—a
GPS--powered location device for lost keys—it was quickly dismissed. (“So sorry,” posted one Quirk.
“Three Christmases ago I got this from RadioShack.”) 
<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/> Even if a product gets community approval, it will only make it to market if enough Web
surfers pre-order it to cover production costs. “This is where we find out if a good idea is a good
product,” Kaufman says. “The world doesn’t need more junk.” In fact, less than a third of Quirky
products get made. 
<br clear="none"/>
<br clear="none"/> Jeff Scholen, a 41-year-old medical-device manufacturer from Atlanta, spent 10 minutes
sketching an idea for a power-cord holder, then submitted it to Quirky. The PowerCurl has since
sold more than 6500 units and netted Scholen about $6000. Michael McCoy, a 29-year-old mechanical
engineer from Hampton, Va., is Quirky’s most successful inventor so far, netting around $30,000
since his iPad case—the Cloak—went on sale. “I’m going to pay off some bills and then submit some
other ideas,” he says.

<br clear="none"/> Quirky does have its skeptics. “It can be viable for making niche products, but the question
is whether they produce something that has mass appeal,” says analyst Michael Gartenberg of the
technology-research firm Altimeter Group. Kaufman is confident that his business will continue to
grow, but he is also enjoying the moment. “This is so much fun,” he says, munching on a waffle. “I
come to work every day and make stuff!”</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br clear="none"/></body></html>
