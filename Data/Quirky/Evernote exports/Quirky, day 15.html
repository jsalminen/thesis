To the site. I have 15 votes again.
<div><ul><li>Voting for tagline for Prop Power Rugged. They use the wikisurvey for this task, too.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Again, 20 comparisons to make</li><li>There's lots of options. Largest ranks are around 700th. People submit a lot.</li><li>Just noticed there's a total number shown. For this task it's 790.</li><li>This is a fun task. I could do them a lot more. Wonder if I can participate again?</li></ul></li><li>There's two ways they do the taglines. One is with the old version, where people submit taglines (or names) and then wikisurveys. I wonder if they are alternatives or consecutive phases?</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>No, I can't. It says the task is completed, and suggest me to participate to something else. This goes a bit against the original idea of wikisurveys, which was that an active user could participate as much as he likes.</li><li>Oh wait, yes I can! There's an option to continue voting</li></ul></li><li>Checked the user who submitted the idea for prob power rugged. So far he's earned $6,48 and submitted 67 ideas. $10 per idea means he's spent almost 100 times more on the site than he has earned. Interesting. Is this a common pattern? I could check the winning users, or even try to collect data more systematically.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Actually he hasn't lost money. He's a pro user. Pro users can submit unlimited ideas.</li><li>Becoming a pro user costs $99 per year.</li></ul></li><li>Continuing to vote for Prop power rugged names. This is my favorite crowdsourcing task so far.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Total of 1126 names suggested. This is a good way to name a product!!</li><li>Tried the skip option. It just gives me the next evaluation really quickly. No extra questions like in original wikisurvey</li><li>I completed again, at 40 questions. Do I now get more influence? Now this task is getting a bit boring again.</li><li>And again, 60 questions is enough for me.</li></ul></li><li>Wondering if anyone has commented or voted my suggestion for Piggy App. Where can I see that easily?</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Found out I can download my influence as a .csv file.</li><li>Also found I can see all my activity in one place under my profile page. That's handy!</li><li>No one has commented. I noticed that I can sort the comments to an idea by highest ranked, but I cannot sort ideas like that. Good thinking, Quirky!</li></ul></li><li>Participating to last task (apart from idea evaluation) that's still undone at the moment: Nursing bag community design.</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Patent pending. Then why not produce by herself?</li><li>Watched video demo.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The porudct development timeline shows also the results of research. 660 members answered a survey. That's a good number for this kind of market survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Voted for duck hunter vest. Going trough designs starting from newest.</li><li>Voted for Hobo back</li><li>Voted for more rigid tissue. The original looked a bit weak. Almost cancelled the vote when someone had commented against the design.</li></ul></li><li>Browsing ideas. I still have 15 votes to spend. Newest first</li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>I tend to open resubmitted ideas. That might be a good advertisement</li><li>Checked a resubmitted braking skateboard. Didn't vote.</li><li>Voted for rotating instrument cable for musicians. Description started with a real problem.</li><li>Voted for self-charging keyboard. Good idea, if it is feasible.</li><li>Voted pivot shower. I like copying a solution to other uses, but perhaps this is not the oneâ€¦ Was tempted to looka at comments before deciding whether to vote, but resisted.</li><li>Voted for cordless pivot power. App could work, but didn't like the cordless part.</li><li>Voted for solar panel kit</li><li>Voted for some add-on to patio aquaponic system</li><li>Voted for organic garden / fish tank</li><li>Did not vote for lens cap holder</li></ul></li><li>Checking the most active ideas. Not very interesting.<br/></li><li style="list-style: none"><ul><li>Voted for Bathtub hair strainer</li></ul></li></ul></div></body></html>
