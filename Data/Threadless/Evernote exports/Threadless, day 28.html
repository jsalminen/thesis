Scoring designs. It's my favorite activity on the site
<div>
<ul>
<li>Clicked view in full size from the front page. One of the baseball tees, so that's what I'm scoring. Newest first, I assume.</li>
<li>Got bored, switching to Threadless challenge<br/></li>
<li>Platform jamming a bit</li>
<li>Blah. Too slow, either connection or the site</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the forum</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Commented on a post. I don't do this very regularly.</li>
<li>For many the feedback on the forums seems to be an important part of the design process.</li>
<li>People have sometimes playful collaborations and challenges on the forum, such as swapsies and threaduels</li>
<li>Considered giving critique for a design, but I find it hard to tell the design suck. I would like to say it in a positive tone.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Made a comment. That was actually quite fun. Perhaps I could comment more on these WIP threads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another comment on another design. This time I think I gave useful feedback.(dandelion/note design) Is this design good or bad??? thread.</li>
