The scoring crawler is pretty much ready to go. It's not very pretty or sophisticated, but should more or less work. I still need to decide how to collect data: my estimate is that collecting data on 9000 evaluations would probably take around 12 hours. An issue to consider is from what time period the data should be collected
<div>
<ul>
<li>Recent data will not contain many printed designs</li>
<li>Month old designs might be printed, but it can take almost a year before the decision in some cases</li>
<li>Perhaps the best thing to do would be to take a sample, or maybe samples of data from older time periods. This way most designs would have been printed if they're going to get printed</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring some designs. What else would I do? Newest in Threadless that I haven't scored</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Scored some designs. Feeling tired, but this task is still easy.</li>
</ul>
<div>Quickly checking the forum.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Well, well, well, what have we here! Someone is stealing and submitting someone else's designs to Threadless!</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>IPR theft could indeed be an issue here, but as people suggest in the thread, providing Threadless with high quality design documents would be very difficult for the thiefâ€¦</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's also a discussion on commissioned work rates. Many of the participants definitely are at least semi-professional graphic designers.</li>
<li>Clipped some random threads from the forum.</li>
