Again time for only a quick visit. I've still scored all the Threadless challenge designs. I wonder when do they get more? Is there some kind of gate, or are the new designs put online once a week?

<div>Checking what's new on the forum. Everything category.</div>

<ul>
<li>Many threads seem to be about announcing a new design or promising to comment and score in exchange for comments and scores</li>
<li>On a discussion about promoting someone mentions WIP threads to get attention for designs before they go on scoring. I'm guessing this means work in progress.</li>
<li>I could do some guestimate on the proportion of promotion threads to other types of threads.</li>
<li>Found a random thread about dating. It says adding randomness in the topic, so perhaps this is not a typical topic for Threadless?</li>

<ul>
<li>190 designs. First few are not very interesting and general quality seems lower than in tee shirts. Some of these look like they've been drawn on paint!</li>
<li>Checked the rules. They don't say the design should be made with paint or style should be specifically retro.</li>
