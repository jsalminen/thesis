Checking some of the newest forum posts. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Weird thread featuring Deadpool. I guess this is parody. Lots of funny gifs.</li>
<li>I'm getting the feeling that discussing designs on the forum is important part of the design process, at least for some designers. Then again, I don't see the designs that are not posted to the forum, so I cannot guess how typical this behavior is. Just guestimating from the number of new designs every week (some hundred?) and some 120 threads in 24 hour period, I would guess not nearly all do this. But maybe a significant proportion, still?</li>
<li>I could actually collect a sample of newest posts to confirm how many threads out of say 200 hundred most recently updated threads are about feedback on designs.</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring some designs. This is a very easy "at least I'm doing something" option to fall back into, if I can't figure out anything else to do. Scoring Super Cats.</div>

<div>
<ul>
<li>108 designs already. Now is 12 July. How many days since the challenge started? People are making designs fast!</li>
<li>The platform is bugging. I tried to Enter to win a design, and it just showed me a blank grey square. Now I got rid of it and cannot move to the next design</li>
<li>Ended up in different challenge, perhaps Threadless. How did this happen?</li>

<li>Forgot to click super cats while trying to debug the site…</li>

<li>Scored them all! A few great ones, but many 2s and 1s</li>

<div>Checking the shop</div>

<li>I saw a blog post somewhere stating that Threadless has now the shopping covered and they want to focus more on community again</li>
