I finished a simple Threadless Forum crawler yesterday. Downloading data from the forums: All topics and numbers of comments for the past month. I added a 2 s delay to the crawler so it shouldn't bother the site.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Bit of adjusting here and there, but worked out pretty ok. I still have to fix some little issues caused by special characters in some of the topics.</li>
<li>Now I should only decide what to do with the data… Perhaps I'll just code the threads to assess the frequency of certain behaviours</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Promoting designs</li>
<li>Feedback for WIP</li>
<li>Design collaborations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Date range for my data is May 8 - June 15 2013</li>
<li>I could try to build a crawler for getting the scores of designs, too</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Checking out this possibility after scoring some designs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring designs, Threadless, filtered by average score for change. I might want to see some good stuff this time. Not that the content usually was bad, but I want to see some 5 worth designs</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>374 designs left to score. </li>
<li>Just noticed there's a possibility to share desings in scoring in various social media sites</li>
<li>Site chrashed</li>
<li>I'm scoring in many design view. It's faster</li>
<li>Entered to win three roosters</li>
<li>Alright, got bored. The quality also seemed to be going down. The crowd probably can have a good guess on the quality of designs.</li>
</ul>
<div>Ideas for scoring results crawler</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Crawl listing pages. There's 30 designs per page, and at least 300 pages of designs. This only takes us back to March 29…</li>
<li>Make a list of design urls</li>
<li>Crawl design pages</li>
<li>Extract average scores and other available data</li>
<li>Find out which designs have been printed</li>
<li>Match the data</li>
<li>PROFIT!!</li>
</ol>
<div>I has build two crawlers!! </div>
