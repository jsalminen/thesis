Only time for a quick visit. Starting by scoring designs. That's the most obvious thing to do. I could perhaps comment too, but haven't felt like it.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Scoring Threadless challenge. I don't like that much about the others, and they are often empty.</li>
<li>I only have 71 designs left to score. Perhaps I can do them all?</li>
<li>Scored em all!</li>
</ul>
<div>Checked Threadspotting. There's stories about Threadless designs seen in public, for example in tv-shows.</div>
</div>
<div>Checked open positions. Only one at the moment. Not growing as fast as Quirky, but then again I believe Threadless is making profit.</div>
