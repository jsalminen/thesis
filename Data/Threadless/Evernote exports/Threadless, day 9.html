Again visiting the site too late. I'm just going to do the daily evaluation task.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Threadless, newest, single design view like usual</li>
<li>Something's wrong with the platform. Damn slow and gives me errors</li>
<li>Scoring in many design mode. Faster this way, I hope</li>
<li>Weird. If I understood correctly, I can change my evaluations in single design mode but not in many design mode…</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Yep, I changed the score I had given in many design mode in single design mode, even if the platform is slow and buggy at the moment. This is inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scored at least 30 designs. </li>
<li>Super Cats challenge has already 11 designs. I think this challenge was opened only a few days ago. I wonder how long do the challenges typically run? Are there different phases?</li>
<li>Overall I have a feeling that Threadless process is quite simple and straightforward.</li>
</ul>
