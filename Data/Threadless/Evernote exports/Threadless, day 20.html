Front page announced some interesting statistics
<div>
<ul>
<li>$7 120 000 awarded to 1533 artists</li>
<li>2 539 132 community members</li>
<li>280 337 amazing designs submitted</li>
</ul>
<div>This site is bigger than I thought!!</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Investigating where I could find the data on whether a design has been printed. One option is to go to designer's page and check if the design is among the printed. In principle this should work. I could also make the algorithm to save intermediary results, for example after every page, and append it to a data frame or list, so that if something goes wrong I'll still have some results.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Weird, visitng the page again, and now there's another announcement stating very different statistics</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>2 532 797 global community members</li>
<li>522 033 designs submitted</li>
<li>4735 designs printed</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the blog.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Not many new blog posts.</li>
<li>Clipped two older blog pages to get a better idea what kind of stuff do they have up there.</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring some desings. Always a last resort to get something done. Then again, it's an important part of the Threadless process.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>New challenge is up. It's called Impressionists, but no designs yet.</li>
<li>It's easy to get in a flow for a while when scoring desings. The platform should be faster, still. Time is wasted every time the browsers loads a new picture.</li>
</ul>
