Missed 5 days of participating due to PIN-C 2013 conference and Midsummer.
<div>Scoring designs to get something done. Super cats, newest first</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>262 designs to score</li>
<li>I believe my evaluation accuracy varies wildly. I feel like constantly adjusting what is needed to get a certain score based on who knows what</li>
<li>I feel like giving lots of 1s, some of them undeserved</li>
<li>Getting boring</li>
<li>There's announcement on the blog that if I score 100 cat designs I enter a competition. I guess I could do that. Only around 20 to go</li>
<li>Scoring in faster mode, where I can see many designs at once</li>
<li>I have no idea how many designs I have scored. How am I supposed to follow my progress on this challenge?</li>
<li>I believe I've scored enough. Viewing a full design to confirm. Yes, 124 designs left to score.</li>
</ul>
<div>Quick look at the forum, in case there's something going on. Everything is the category</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Couple of threads (or blogs, as they call them) about cheaters.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Someone found a bunch of accounts which have all given average score of 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In another thread people are discussing about suspiciously low average score on Black and White challenge. Someone made a guess that people were just clicking same number instead of really scoring to participate to 100 scoring challenge</li>
<li>Apparently the forums are now used as a substitute for critique phase, that is still work in progress. Meaning: people post their work in progress to forum and other people give them feedback on how to improve it before submitting for scoring.</li>
</ul>
