I feel like there's not that much to learn about Threadless anymore. I'm not going to submit a design or participate in a collaboration due to lack of skills, but otherwise I've done pretty much everything there is to do. Picking designs, surfing the forum, watching videos, reading blog. I still want to crawl some data on scoring results, but that's separate from participating as a user.
<div><br/></div>
<div>One more thing to do is to check out media and research articles on Threadless. Unfortunately the site does not have media section with collection of articles similart to Quirky.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I already have 48 research papers mentioning Threadless and 11 web articles in Evernote. I should check em out. Perhaps make a table which draws together different facts about the site. This is actually a good idea!</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring some designs. Just for the sake of it. Not expecting any surprises.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The difference in lenghts of challenges is curious. The special challenges tend to have more than 20 days time, while the normal Threadless challenge allows only 7 days for scoring of submitted designs.</li>
<li>Threadless, newest, single view</li>
<li>Enter to win this design works now</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Cool retro style Super Mario &lt;3 Princess design.Â </li>
<li>Threadless is asking me to promote the design to my network: Be a pal and like us as much as we like you, Share this design to help it get printed, Be sure to vote for the design. Links to Facebook</li>
<li>Clicket the like button. I think. I was the first one.</li>
<li>Threadless is kind of using the human need for reciprocity: They give me a change to win something, and then ask me to do something for them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scoring is still somewhat flow-inducing. Especially today, when the quality of designs seems to be particularly good.</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the forum</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Clipped some threads, mostly work in progress and such</li>
<li>There's a score 60 Path submissions competition. Trying to do it fast in many view mode.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>This is pretty fast</li>
<li>Gave mostly 2s. I don't like emoticons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
