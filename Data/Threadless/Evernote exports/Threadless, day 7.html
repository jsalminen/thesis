<ul>
<li>Score 25 designs every day for a week and win $250 worth of Threadless stuff. Will do this!</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring designs, Threadless challenge, newest first</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>34 designs left to score. Perhaps I should score only 25? What if I run out of designs?</li>
<li>Scored them all anyway. It was too tempting.</li>
<li>Many good designs today. Mostly threes, several fours and a couple of fives.</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the forum</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Opening a couple of threads in projects category</li>
<li>Found out that when scoring ends the results are displayed. This is a place where I could collect some data!!</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Might be difficult. No easy way to go from one design to next one. Would probably need a crawler to do this properlyâ€¦</li>
<li>Another issue: how to select the sampling method? Perhaps newest first would give a reasonable data set: evaluations shouldn't be correlated with time, at least in the short scale.</li>
