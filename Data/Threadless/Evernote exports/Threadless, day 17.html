Found out that Paulini &amp; al: Design process in collective innovation communities had almost scooped my research. Fortunately they did not go very deep and I hope I still could have something more to say about the sites they examined.

<div>Scoring designs. It's fun and easy way to get something done.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Newest baseball tees. 31 designs in about a week or so.</li>
<li>I'm giving automatically high scores for tees featuring zombies. Zombies somehow feel like a Threadless thing.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Againâ€¦</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scored 'em all!</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the forum</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Opening and clipping interesting looking threads. Everything, newest first.</li>
<li>Thread Duels: there's a playful competition on who can make the best design on the forum. Clipping some pages of the discussion</li>
<li>From long discussions I'm clipping the three first pages and the last one and assuming I get an idea what the discussion is about (or second last, if the last one is almost empty)</li>
</ul>
<div>Watching a process time lapse video</div>

<li>Dude is drawing on photoshop</li>
<li>The process seems to be:</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Pencil draft on paper</li>
<li>Scan &amp; import to photoshop</li>
<li>Redraw the skecth on new layer</li>
<li>Final drawing on yet another layer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cool video showing how draft turn to a line drawing in software</li>
</ul>
<div>Watching another: Time lapse speed painting sherlock holmes vs. werewolf</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h2fNPudm2M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h2fNPudm2M</a><br/></li>
<li>I don't know what the software is. Zooming a lot in and out and tools mostly not visible</li>
<li>Very artistick and skillful in my unsophisticated eyes</li>
<li>I'm guessing photoshop</li>
<li>Black and white, very detailed</li>
<li>Seems like there's many many different tools used skilfully to get different effects and pieces of drawing done</li>
<li><br/></li>
