Whatching TEDxBoulder talk, Jake Nickell, Never stop making
<div>
<ul>
<li>Threadless was a side project for 4 years before turning to a business</li>
<li>"Millions of artists"</li>
<li>"We pay millions of dollars to them"</li>
<li>People submit designs, we put them up for scoring, produce and distribute them.</li>
<li>Crowdsourcing by Jeff Howe. Check what he has written about Threadless!!</li>
<li>Howe: "Making stuff is the most joyful occupation we ever engage"</li>
<li>"Make something cool every day"</li>
<li>Pretty much the essence of the talk by the starter of Threadless was the importance of making things. Make, make and make!</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring desingns. It's late…</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Oxymorons, a challenge I haven't seen before…</li>
<li>Very cool Anarchy rules tee shirt. I even commented, which I don't like to do often</li>
<li>There's a weird square again, when I tried to enter to win the Anarchy shirt</li>
<li>Submitted feedback on the slowness of scoring, and even gave my email! Forgot to clip the feedback, though…</li>
<li>Scored em all, around 30 designs.</li>
