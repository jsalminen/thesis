Checking a blog post about Threadless translation to different languages.

<ul>
<li>It's actually an old post from 2011, but it went to front page because someone commented.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Checked oxymorons and black &amp; white challenge. Kwince is indeed in top as someone stated on the forum. Couple of people already bashing him in the comments for cheating</li>
<li>Scoring new Threadless designs</li>
<li>Many designs in a row from same user</li>
<li>Scored a bunch of designs</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the forum. I have now two main activities at Threadless: scoring and surfing the forum. If I could do graphic design, that would be the third activity I probably would do.</div>
