<div>I'm getting a feeling I understand Threadless. I'll still have to check a couple of things such as how common are feedback threads on the forum compared to number of new designs submitted to the site.</div>
Scoring some designs. Newest in Threadless. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Slow and buggy, perhaps due to mobile connection I'm using.</li>
<li>Enter to win this desing doesn't work. Damn, Would have wanted to win this shirt featuring heavy metal spiderman hand</li>
<li>These bugs are pretty annoying.</li>
<li>I think I managed to enter to win, but still the annoying grey square is in the way and I have to go to front page again.</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Sent some feedback to Threadless for this issue<br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Posted a little comment too. I said something nice.</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking the forums. Perhaps I could critique some designs? I'm a Threadless customer, anyway</div>
<ul>
<li>Seems like I can copy threads to Excel, although it's a bit slow. This could work as data collection method for guestinmating forum critique to submissions ratio</li>
<li>I could probably make a R script to download the data… That would be pretty handy and absolutely sweet!!!</li>
<li>Gonna try it!</li>
</ul>
