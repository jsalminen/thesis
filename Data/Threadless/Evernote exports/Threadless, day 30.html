Last day to participate. I'm trying to find things on the site that I haven't seen before. Just in case I've missed something important.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Found some submission guidelines and assets. Clipping them from a couple of open Challenges.</li>
<li>Submission guidelines and assets seem to be about the same for different challenges.</li>
<li>Downloaded Threadless workshop toolkit for teachers</li>
<li>Clipped current RSS feed content</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>New products feed seems to be only old content, newest message is 5 months old. But the rate of announcements is high. For example in January they announced new tee shirts seven times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clipped a page from Threadless Tumblr blog site</li>
<li>Not clipping Flickr. It's just lots of photos, would not work in analysis on Dedoose.</li>
<li>Clipped Threadless YouTube page. Shows some content on the site.</li>
</ul>
Checking the mobile site on iPhone<br/>
<ul>
<li>Four main parts on the front page: Reprinted designs (ad for shop), Pick designs, Visit our Blog, and Go to forum</li>
<li>Picking designs on mobile</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>Slow!!!</li>
<li>Server error…</li>
<li>Managed to score one design, I think…</li>
<li>This is slow and frustrating. Impossible to use for scoring, really. Way too slow.</li>
<li>I quit! The app just chrashed after trying to score one design!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>I'm done! Threadless haven't really surprised me with new features for some time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Just in case checking the forum. Clipping only if there's something completely new to me.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Although not new stuff, I clipped a couple of threads. </li>
</ul>
<div>Finally done!</div>
</div>
