Decided to investigate Threadless next. It's one of the prime examples of crowdsourcing. Keen to know how they do it. I've bought some shirts from the company before, and I already have an account, but I haven't been an active participant on the site.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Just noticed I've been registered on the site for over 4 years!! I've also scored 115 designs out of which 2 made it to production! Nice feedback straight in the beginning!</li>
</ul>
<div>Looking around at the site</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Things the user can do are nicely shown on the front site: Make, Pick, Play, Shop</li>
<li>Make is divided to four categories: </li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Start with an idea</li>
<li>Make it better</li>
<li>Submit your design</li>
<li>Make more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browsing the instructions</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There's tutorial videos for doing graphic design. Should check these out!</li>
<li>Threadless seems to have design challenges: Threadless challenge is a big ongoing challenge, others have themes and are smaller</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Found a blog and long post on how a design for a t-shirt was made</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Blog posts seem to be short and include lots of pictures. The blog format is a continuous scroll, and posts have to be clicked only if I want to read comments</li>
<li>Actually it's just a quite long page, and there's 58 pages of blog posts…</li>
<li>Clipped the first page of blog posts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checking out the help centre. Topics are mostly related to shopping.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Found freaquently answered questions on submitting designs. Clipping them.</li>
<li>Also clipping the interesting ones on what is Threadless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Started following Threadless on Twitter.</li>
<li>Trying to score designs</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Wonder what do I get out of this?</li>
<li>Wow, there's two methods to score designs: One where you see many designs at once and scroll down the site, and another, where user sees only one, and after scoring the system gives the next one. It also shows automatically (or at least semi-) different pictures of the same design.</li>
<li>Almost all designs seem to be "Awkward". I guess there's a challenge going on…</li>
<li>I have 52 designs left to score</li>
<li>19 designs left in one design mode. This is actually kinda nice. Trying the other way for the rest</li>
<li>I don't like this other approach that much. Pictures are small and voting numbers are on the way. The scale is 1-5, by the way. I haven't seen any instructions on how to do this, but I've assumed that 5 is good. Actually, I saw! They were hidden in the buttons. The scale is Ugh. Meh. OK. YAY! $!!!</li>
<li>Found out I was scoring design in awkward challenge</li>
<li>There's 10 challenges going on at the moment</li>
<li>This scoring is fun. I want to do more, but definitely in single design view mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scoring Black &amp; White submissions</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>There's only two. That was fast.</li>
<li>Headline for commenting is "Say something nice". If commentators have their own designs the platform suggest that I score them, with a link</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scoring page can be filterd by newest, oldest, average score and title. Apparently scores are aggregated using average?</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Scoring some designs in Threadless challenge. I have 400 designs left to score.</li>
<li>Scoring is open for 7 days for these submissions</li>
<li>366 designs left. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filtered by oldest. Now scoring is open for 1 day. </li>
<li>Filtered by average score. In many design mode my current score is shown on top of the design. Seems like I cannot change it.</li>
<li>Found demo page for Critiquing designs before they go to scoring. It's not implemented yet.</li>
