I have to remove pictures from some of the web clips due to Dedoose complaining about the file size.

<div>I got an email from Threadless promoting a Guatemalan designer with 16 designs. </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>"Visit his shop" says the email. I visit. It's a sub-page on Threadless displaying all the designs he's made.</li>
</ul>
<div>Surfing around the site</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Watching How to Threadless. Good instruction on how the site works. To do: write up this talk. Major part of official rules of the site are covered here!</li>
<li>Cool instructions or making of story of Diamonds are forever design in blog post</li>
<li>Clipped another creation story, too. Actually, I'm clipping all six.</li>
<li>Every product is a canvas, says the site. Do they have templates?</li>
</ul>
<div>Watching a video tutorial on making a submission document</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Talking about how to prepare a scanned document ready for submission. This seems to need some skills and at least semi professional software. Dude in the video is using photoshop</li>
<li>Overall, I already have feeling that the average quality of submissions at Threadless is very high. I haven't seen anything really crappy yet. </li>
<li>Person who made this video (someone from Threadless community, not from the personnel) seems to be a pro designer. At least he's very skilled.</li>
</ul>

Scoring some designs in Onion challenge. All designs are based on a Onion headline.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Newest first, I'm obviously scoring in single entry mode</li>
<li>Scoring is open for 20 days. Why so? Normally scoring is only open for 7 days. Is this for the marketing purposes?</li>
<li>Scored all. There weren't that many. Mostly threes.</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring some designs in Threadless challenge</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I'm quite critical scorer. Mostly threes, twos and ones, occasional fours and rare fives. Most designs are still decent. I'm not evaluating whether they are good, but rather whether I would wear them. That's pretty tough scale.</li>
<li>At least in single view mode I can change my scores.</li>
<li>Scored 100 designs. I'm all the time waiting for the next (rare) really good one to which I could give a five.</li>
<li>The platform always gives me a new one after scoring. This is automatic and somewhat tempting. It would be so easy to score one more design…</li>
<li>I'm at the point where scoring is open only 6 days now. So does threadless get something like 100 new designs per day?</li>
</ul>
