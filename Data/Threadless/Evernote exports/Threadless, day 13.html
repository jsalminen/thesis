Missed a visit to the site yesterday.
<div>Front page</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Advertisements for shopping tee shirts and other producs</li>
<li>1139 designs to score, 5043 designs printed. That's a lot!</li>
<li>Checking the shop</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul>
<li>There's plenty more products than just tee shirts!</li>
<li>I guess they're expanding to things that work well as canvas for art</li>
<li>29 pages of iPhone covers…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Scoring some newest designs in Threadless challenge. There's always new content. Other categories tend to be somewhat empty.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I've already scored the newest designs, or at least the front page. Do they put the desings up for scoring in patches?</li>
<li>Filtering by Haven't scored. That solved the issue!</li>
<li>Scored maybe 40 designs. I think what keeps me going is the expectation of seeing a great design every now and then. Something worth a five could be just the next one…</li>
</ul>
<div>Checking what's going on in the forum. Seems to be an important part of Threadless.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nothing that interesting in the first clance. Clipped the rest of the four-part unofficial Threadless guide, though.</li>
<li>I doubt I'm going to submit any designs to Threadless due to lack of skills, but I could watch some guide videos to get better understanding of what creating designs requires and how that process goes.</li>
</ul>
